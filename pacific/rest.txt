0	,
0	with
0	a
0	pound
0	and
0	a
0	half
0	of
0	yams
0	,
0	instead
0	of
0	bread
0	;

0	In
0	the
0	Southern
0	parts
0	of
PLACE-B	New
PLACE-I	Zeeland
0	we
0	find
0	the
0	formation
0	of
0	mould
0	and
0	soil
0	much
0	more
0	forward
0	,
0	because
0	its
0	climate
0	is
0	milder
0	,
0	the
0	summer
0	longer
0	,
0	and
0	vegetation
0	more
0	quick
0	and
0	strong
0	:
0	but
0	,
0	upon
0	the
0	whole
0	,
0	we
0	observe
0	the
0	same
0	analogy
0	in
0	its
0	origin
0	.

0	On
0	the
0	26th
0	,
0	at
0	five
0	in
0	the
0	morning
0	,
0	we
0	had
0	a
0	heavy
0	fall
0	of
0	snow
0	,
0	which
0	lasted
0	four
0	hours
0	,
0	with
0	piercing
0	winds
0	the
0	whole
0	day
0	.

0	After
0	the
0	usual
0	salutations
0	,
0	they
0	entered
0	into
0	general
0	conversation
0	,
0	when
0	our
0	gentlemen
0	soon
0	discovered
0	that
0	the
0	Major
0	was
0	not
0	only
0	a
0	man
0	of
0	breeding
0	,
0	but
0	of
0	general
0	knowledge
0	;

0	Through
0	these
0	they
0	made
0	their
0	way
0	with
0	little
0	opposition
0	till
0	the
0	lake
0	appeared
0	to
0	deepen
0	,
0	when
0	a
0	most
0	stubborn
0	woody
0	copse
0	seemed
0	to
0	bid
0	defiance
0	to
0	their
0	further
0	progress
0	.

0	At
0	half
0	past
0	ten
0	,
0	P.
0	M.
0	we
0	were
0	put
0	about
0	,
0	finding
0	by
0	our
0	logbook
0	and
0	watch
0	,
0	that
0	we
0	were
0	fifty
0	miles
0	to
0	leeward
0	of
0	our
0	port
0	.

0	and
0	here
0	we
0	purchased
0	yams
0	and
0	potatoes
0	for
0	our
0	summer
0	's
0	consumption
0	,
0	which
0	the
0	companies
0	of
0	both
0	ships
0	were
0	glad
0	to
0	accept
0	in
0	exchange
0	for
0	their
0	allowance
0	of
0	bread
0	,
0	that
0	part
0	of
0	their
0	food
0	being
0	both
0	scanty
0	and
0	bad
0	.

0	Pounded
0	,
0	we
0	made
0	an
0	excellent
0	liquor
0	from
0	it
0	,
0	very
0	pleasant
0	,
0	and
0	exceedingly
0	wholesome
0	.

0	On
0	these
0	occasions
0	we
0	saw
0	first
0	small
0	pieces
0	of
0	loose
0	,
0	broken
0	ice
0	,
0	full
0	of
0	holes
0	and
0	pores
0	like
0	a
0	spunge
0	,
0	thus
0	wafted
0	by
0	the
0	continual
0	agitation
0	of
0	the
0	waves
0	;

0	In
0	the
0	Northern
0	seas
0	,
0	it
0	is
0	a
0	common
0	and
0	obvious
0	phaenomenon
0	,
0	observed
0	almost
0	every
0	year
0	,
0	that
0	the
0	ice
0	moves
0	towards
0	warmer
0	climates
0	.

0	They
0	had
0	likewise
0	some
0	very
0	pretty
0	baskets
0	of
0	their
0	own
0	making
0	,
0	with
0	other
0	utensils
0	,
0	which
0	plainly
0	indicated
0	a
0	communication
0	with
0	foreign
0	traders
0	.

0	She
0	was
0	a
0	bark
0	of
0	about
0	80
0	tons
0	,
0	and
0	had
0	two
0	guns
0	mounted
0	,
0	which
0	she
0	fired
0	as
0	a
0	salute
0	,
0	when
0	she
0	dropt
0	anchor
0	,
0	and
0	was
0	answered
0	by
0	a
0	volley
0	from
0	the
0	garrison
0	,
0	which
0	consisted
0	of
0	a
0	subaltern
0	and
0	twenty-five
0	soldiers
0	.

0	they
0	were
0	of
0	a
0	dark
0	copper-colour
0	,
0	with
0	lank
0	black
0	hair
0	,
0	which
0	they
0	tied
0	in
0	a
0	knot
0	behind
0	;

0	their
0	breadth
0	from
0	four
0	to
0	five
0	feet
0	over
0	in
0	the
0	middle
0	,
0	and
0	gradually
0	narrowing
0	,
0	like
0	all
0	others
0	,
0	to
0	both
0	ends
0	,
0	but
0	the
0	stem
0	much
0	higher
0	than
0	the
0	stern
0	.

0	These
0	are
0	all
0	monopolized
0	by
0	the
0	Russian
0	Company
0	,
0	already
0	mentioned
0	in
0	our
0	account
0	of
0	the
0	last
0	summer
0	's
0	voyage
0	,
0	and
0	not
0	a
0	skin
0	is
0	to
0	be
0	had
0	from
0	the
0	Kamshatskadales
0	.

0	We
0	were
0	,
0	in
0	less
0	than
0	an
0	hour
0	,
0	surrounded
0	with
0	more
0	than
0	thirty
0	canoes
0	,
0	with
0	rock
0	fish
0	and
0	dried
0	salmon
0	,
0	which
0	they
0	exchanged
0	for
0	beads
0	,
0	small
0	nails
0	,
0	or
0	any
0	thing
0	we
0	offered
0	them
0	.

0	but
0	fortunately
0	laying
0	hold
0	of
0	a
0	rope
0	hanging
0	from
0	the
0	fore-chains
0	into
0	the
0	water
0	,
0	he
0	was
0	got
0	on
0	board
0	,
0	without
0	any
0	other
0	hurt
0	than
0	a
0	slight
0	bruise
0	on
0	one
0	shoulder
0	.

0	Upon
0	these
0	representations
0	the
0	Commodore
0	relinquished
0	his
0	design
0	,
0	and
0	Capt.
PERSON-B	King
0	,
0	with
0	other
0	officers
0	,
0	were
0	sent
0	in
0	a
0	Company
0	's
0	ship
0	,
0	assisted
0	by
0	one
0	or
0	two
0	gentlemen
0	belonging
0	to
0	the
0	factory
0	,
0	to

0	,
0	to
0	purchase
0	cannon
0	and
0	such

0	stores
0	as
0	were
0	not
0	to
0	be
0	had
0	at
PLACE-B	Macao
0	.

0	He
0	lamented
0	his
0	loss
0	with
0	abundance
0	of
0	tears
0	,
0	and
0	earnestly
0	besought
0	us
0	to
0	keep
0	their
0	coming
0	a
0	secret
0	,
0	for
0	if
0	it
0	should
0	be
0	known
0	,
0	it
0	would
0	prove
0	fatal
0	to
0	their
0	whole
0	fraternity
0	.

0	but
PERSON-B	Capt.
PERSON-I	Cook
0	and
0	the
0	other
0	Gentlemen
0	promised
0	to
0	attend
0	.

0	They
0	were
0	strengthened
0	by
0	cross
0	bars
0	,
0	which
0	served
0	both
0	for
0	feats
0	and
0	stretchers
0	,
0	and
0	had
0	small
0	out-riggers
0	,
0	to
0	prevent
0	over-setting
0	.

0	Under
0	this
0	mistake
0	a
0	few
0	guns
0	were
0	fired
0	from
0	the
0	ships
0	to
0	disperse
0	them
0	,
0	by
0	which
PERSON-B	the
PERSON-I	King
0	's
0	nephew
0	,
0	Maiha
0	Maiha
0	,
0	was
0	wounded
0	,
0	and
0	a
0	poor
0	woman
0	lost
0	her
0	arm
0	.

0	And
0	as
0	it
0	was
0	agreed
0	that
0	both
0	ships
0	could
0	carry
0	more
0	guns
0	,
0	if
0	any
0	were
0	to
0	be
0	purchased
0	,
0	the
0	Commodore
0	was
0	for
0	taking
0	the
0	ships
0	to
0	Canton
0	,
0	till
0	persuaded
0	from
0	it
0	by
0	some
0	gentlemen
0	belonging
0	to
0	the
0	English
0	factory
0	,
0	who
0	undertook
0	to
0	negociate
0	the
0	business
0	without
0	giving
0	umbrage
0	to
0	the
0	Chinese
0	,
0	who
0	certainly
0	would
0	,
0	they
0	said
0	,
0	be
0	offended
0	at
0	the
0	appearance
0	of
0	ships
0	of
0	war
0	in
0	their
0	river
0	,
0	and
0	would
0	oppose
0	their
0	progress
0	;

0	They
0	were
0	then
0	at
0	a
0	distance
0	from
0	the
0	turtlers
0	,
0	and
0	in
0	the
0	midst
0	a
0	trackless
0	cover
0	,
0	with
0	nothing
0	but
0	lew
0	trees
0	to
0	direct
0	their
0	return
0	;

0	and
0	of
0	their
0	manner
0	of
0	living
0	we
0	know
0	but
0	little
0	.

0	They
0	descended
0	by
0	means
0	of
0	a
0	ladder
0	,
0	made
0	by
0	cutting
0	notches
0	in
0	a
0	beam
0	,
0	deep
0	enough
0	to
0	receive
0	the
0	toes
0	and
0	the
0	ball
0	of
0	the
0	foot
0	;

0	On
0	the
0	28th
0	,
0	in
0	the
0	morning
0	,
0	we
0	sounded
0	at
0	24
0	fathom
0	,
0	the
0	tide
0	still
0	setting
0	strong
0	to
0	the
0	southward
0	at
0	the
0	rate
0	of
0	five
0	and
0	six
0	knots
0	an
0	hour
0	;

0	On
0	the
0	9th
0	,
0	at
0	five
0	,
0	A.
0	M.
0	land
0	appeared
0	from
0	S.
0	E.
0	to
0	E.
0	like
0	two
0	islands
0	,
0	but
0	,
0	after
0	fatigueing
0	trials
0	,
0	we
0	found
0	them
0	join
0	to
0	the
0	main
0	land
0	.

0	for
0	it
0	is
0	highly
0	probable
0	,
0	that
0	a
0	land
0	of
0	so
0	great
0	extent
0	contains
0	high
0	mountains
0	in
0	its
0	interior
0	parts
0	;

0	They
0	brought
0	,
0	besides
0	skins
0	,
0	great
0	quantities
0	of
0	fish
0	,
0	with
0	plenty
0	of
0	game
0	,
0	which
0	we
0	purchased
0	of
0	them
0	for
0	glass
0	bowls
0	,
0	looking-glasses
0	,
0	nails
0	,
0	hatchets
0	,
0	or
0	whatever
0	utensils
0	or
0	toys
0	were
0	either
0	useful
0	or
0	ornamental
0	.

0	Those
0	,
0	which
0	are
0	surrounded
0	by
0	a
0	reef
0	and
0	by
0	a
0	fertile
0	plain
0	,
0	along
0	the
0	sea-shores
0	,
0	have
0	commonly
0	a
0	more
0	gentle
0	slope
0	;

0	and
0	for
0	that
0	purpose
0	a
0	house
0	was
0	procured
0	for
0	the
0	reception
0	of
0	the
0	former
0	,
0	and
0	a
0	contrivance
0	made
0	for
0	having
0	the
0	latter
0	dry
0	.

0	This
0	day
0	the
0	gentlemen
0	in
0	the
0	gun-room
0	dined
0	on
0	a
0	fricassee
0	of
0	rats
0	,
0	which
0	they
0	accounted
0	a
0	venison
0	feast
0	;

PERSON-B	Capt.
PERSON-I	Cook
0	,
0	the
0	short
0	time
0	he
0	remained
0	at
0	Atooi
0	,
0	visited
0	the
0	morais
0	on
0	the
0	island
0	,
0	which
0	formerly
0	had
0	been
0	most
0	magnificent
0	structures
0	,
0	but
0	were
0	now
0	much
0	in
0	decay
0	,
0	but
0	still
0	preserved
0	all
0	the
0	appearances
0	of
0	human
0	sacrifices
0	;

0	As
0	soon
0	as
0	we
0	came
0	in
0	sight
0	,
0	she
0	made
0	sail
0	,
0	and
0	we
0	followed
0	with
0	all
0	the
0	sail
0	we
0	could
0	crowd
0	till
0	about
0	midnight
0	,
0	when
0	we
0	were
0	surprised
0	by
0	a
0	sudden
0	squall
0	,
0	which
0	split
0	our
0	main
0	top-sail
0	,
0	and
0	shivered
0	our
0	jib
0	to
0	ribbons
0	;

0	In
0	their
0	progress
0	they
0	were
0	fortunate
0	enough
0	to
0	discover
0	a
0	cove
0	,
0	the
0	most
0	convenient
0	that
0	could
0	be
0	wished
0	;

0	While
0	the
0	cutters
0	were
0	on
0	this
0	service
0	,
0	the
0	boats
0	continued
0	wooding
0	and
0	watering
0	,
0	and
0	before
0	the
0	return
0	of
0	the
0	former
0	,
0	the
0	latter
0	had
0	got
0	the
0	full
0	complement
0	of
0	both
0	on
0	board
0	,
0	and
0	the
0	ships
0	were
0	in
0	readiness
0	to
0	depart
0	.

0	He
0	was
0	a
0	most
0	affecting
0	spectacle
0	,
0	blistered
0	from
0	head
0	to
0	foot
0	by
0	poisonous
0	insects
0	,
0	whose
0	venomous
0	stings
0	had
0	caused
0	such
0	an
0	intolerable
0	itching
0	,
0	that
0	his
0	very
0	blood
0	was
0	inflamed
0	by
0	constant
0	rubbing
0	.

0	Their
0	clothing
0	consisted
0	of
0	a
0	cap
0	,
0	a
0	frock
0	,
0	a
0	pair
0	of
0	breeches
0	,
0	a
0	pair
0	of
0	boots
0	,
0	and
0	a

0	all
0	made
0	of

0	of

0	,

0	vessel
0	,
0	though
0	she
0	had
0	but
0	one
0	mast
0	,
0	appeared
0	to
0	be
0	higher
0	at
0	each
0	end
0	than
0	in
0	the
0	midship
0	,
0	very
0	shor
0	•
0	,
0	and
0	built
0	much
0	in
0	the
0	manner
0	of
0	the
0	Chinese
0	junks
0	.

0	This

0	We
0	instantly

0	manned
0	our
0	boats
0	,
0	and
0	in
0	three

0	for

0	for

0	and
0	when

0	nothing

0	appeared
0	as

0	as
0	the

0	This
0	request
0	was
0	readily
0	granted
0	,
0	at
0	the
0	same
0	time
0	giving
0	the
0	Captain
0	to
0	understand
0	,
0	that
0	the
0	great
PERSON-B	King
0	was
0	absent
0	,
0	that
0	he
0	had
0	lately
0	been
0	at
0	war
0	with
PERSON-B	the
PERSON-I	King
0	of
0	the
0	neighbouring
0	island
0	of
0	Maw-whee
0	,
0	that
0	he
0	was
0	employed
0	in
0	settling
0	the
0	terms
0	of
0	peace
0	,
0	and
0	that
0	in
0	less
0	than
0	ten
0	days
0	he
0	was
0	expected

0	.

0	On
0	the
0	1st
0	of
0	July
0	,
0	the
0	weather
0	began
0	to
0	grow
0	hazy
0	,
0	with
0	thick
0	fogs
0	.

0	but
0	now
0	,
0	on
0	our
0	return
0	,
0	it
0	was
0	matter
0	of
0	surprize
0	to
0	find
0	the
0	fruits
0	ripe
0	,
0	and
0	the
0	harvest
0	in
0	full
0	perfection
0	.

0	and
0	,
0	if
0	not
0	well
0	attended
0	to
0	,
0	often
0	alarms
0	the
0	navigator
0	with
0	the
0	fear
0	of
0	soundings
0	,
0	or
0	even
0	shoals
0	.

0	and
0	it
0	evidently
0	confirms
0	the
0	above
0	assertion
0	,
0	which
0	I
0	think
0	I
0	have
0	a
0	right
0	to
0	apply
0	to
0	the
0	freezing
0	of
0	salt-water
0	.

0	Here
0	they
0	safely
0	secured
0	their
0	cutter
0	,
0	and
0	near
0	the
0	shore
0	they
0	erected
0	a
0	kind
0	of
0	hut
0	,
0	to
0	which
0	they
0	carried
0	their
0	provisions
0	,
0	and
0	sat
0	down
0	to
0	rest
0	and
0	to
0	refresh
0	.

0	We
0	steered
0	all
0	night
0	W.
0	by
0	N.
0	and
0	next
0	morning
0	found
0	ourselves
0	almost
0	surrounded
0	with
0	fields
0	of
0	ice
0	drifting
0	to
0	the
0	southward
0	.

0	While
0	every
0	thing
0	was
0	getting
0	ready
0	,
0	the
0	officers
0	diverted
0	themselves
0	as
0	usual
0	with
0	shooting
0	and
0	surveying
0	the
0	country
0	;

0	He
0	therefore
0	advised
0	the
0	remains
0	of
0	the
0	Commander
0	to
0	be
0	deposited
0	at
0	the
0	foot
0	of
0	a
0	tree
0	,
0	the
0	scite
0	of
0	which
0	was
0	to
0	be
0	included
0	in
0	the
0	body
0	of
0	the
0	new
0	church
0	,
0	where
0	the
0	Captain
0	's
0	bones
0	might
0	probably
0	rest
0	for
0	ages
0	undisturbed
0	.

0	and
0	Next
0	day
0	,
0	March
0	1
0	,
0	about
0	noon
0	,
0	we
0	moored
0	in
0	our
0	old
0	birth
0	,
0	which
0	,
0	notwithstanding
0	,
0	had
0	a
0	most
0	beautiful
0	appearance
0	from
0	the
0	sea
0	,
0	being
0	well
0	cultivated
0	,
0	and
0	full
0	of
0	villages
0	.

0	Besides
0	the
0	natural
0	productions
0	of
0	the
0	country
0	,
0	we
0	purchased
0	in
0	these
0	islands
0	many
0	tons
0	of
0	salt
0	,
0	much
0	of
0	their
0	cordage
0	and
0	cloth
0	,
0	and
0	a
0	great
0	variety
0	of
0	artificial
0	curiosities
0	,
0	such
0	as
0	their
0	weapons
0	of
0	war
0	,
0	their
0	instruments
0	for
0	fishing
0	;

0	In
0	the
0	evening
0	a
0	fresh
0	breeze
0	sprang
0	up
0	,
0	and
0	we
0	coasted
0	along
0	shore
0	,
0	but
0	saw
0	no
0	inhabitants
0	,
0	though
0	many
0	fires
0	were
0	observed
0	in
0	the
0	night
0	within
0	land
0	.

0	In
0	the
0	rest
0	of
0	the
0	isles
0	belonging
0	to
0	the
PLACE-B	New
PLACE-I	Hebrides
0	,
0	we
0	frequently
0	observed
0	large
0	streams
0	of
0	water
0	forming
0	cascades
0	on
0	the
0	steep
0	descents
0	of
0	hills
0	,
0	and
0	thus
0	precipitating
0	themselves
0	down
0	and
0	soon
0	mixing
0	with
0	the
0	briny
0	fluid
0	of
0	the
0	ocean
0	.

0	and
0	for
0	a
0	spare
0	cable
0	for
0	our
0	small
0	bower
0	,
0	that
0	we
0	had
0	being
0	near
0	worn
0	out
0	.

0	Early
0	next
0	morning
0	,
0	we
0	once
0	more
0	attempted
0	the
0	entrance
0	of
0	the
0	bay
0	,
0	and
0	finding
0	the
0	ice
0	drifted
0	,
0	we
0	conceived
0	hopes
0	that
0	we
0	might
0	be
0	able
0	to
0	force
0	a
0	passage
0	through
0	the
0	loose
0	ice
0	,
0	which
0	,
0	now
0	the
0	weather
0	was
0	fine
0	,
0	did
0	not
0	appear
0	so
0	formidable
0	as
0	before
0	.

0	But
0	being
0	disapppointed
0	in
0	the
0	discovery
0	of
0	this
0	land
0	,
0	though
0	we
0	penetrated
0	beyond

0	,
0	and
0	once
0	beyond

0	concerning
0	the

0	of
0	the
0	pretended
0	Southern

0	,
0	I
0	thought
0	it
0	necessary
0	to
0	enquire
0	,
0	what
0	reasons
0	chiefly
0	induced
0	the
0	above
0	authors
0	to
0	form
0	the
0	opinion
0	that
0	the
0	ice
0	floating
0	in
0	the
0	ocean
0	,
0	must
0	be
0	formed
0	near

0	,
0	or
0	that
0	an
PLACE-B	Austral
PLACE-I	land
0	is
0	absolutely
0	requisite
0	for
0	that
0	purpose
0	,
PLACE-B	F
0	and
0	having
0	looked
0	for
0	their
0	arguments
0	,
0	I
0	find

0	amount
0	chiefly
0	to
0	this

0	Our

0	obliged

0	a

0	I
0	will

0	Though

0	the

0	,
0	with

0	E.
0	after

0	The

0	16

0	,
0	that

0	In

0	between
0	compleating
0	our

0	After

0	found

PLACE-B	A-Namocka
0	in
0	the

0	we

0	a

0	in

0	The

0	but
0	such
0	was

0	that
PERSON-B	Capt.

0	shared

0	On

0	no

0	and
0	as
0	they

0	no

0	collect
0	in

0	than
0	the

0	of

0	which

0	Fortunately
0	for

0	,
0	we
0	had
0	,
0	in
0	the

0	,
0	a
0	shift
0	of
0	wind
0	from
0	W.
0	N.
0	W.
0	with
0	a
0	steady
0	breeze
0	,
0	when
0	our
0	Captain
0	,
0	looking
0	over
0	our
0	starboard
0	quarter
0	,
0	discerned
0	the
0	ice
0	to
0	the
0	southward
0	,
0	seemingly
0	to
0	leave
0	the
0	ship
0	,
0	and
0	soon
0	heard
0	a
0	crash
0	,
0	as
0	if
0	a
0	thousand
0	rocks
0	had
0	been
0	rent
0	from

0	foundations
0	;

0	All
0	the
0	Americans
0	we
0	had
0	seen
0	since
0	our
0	arrival
0	on
0	that
0	coast
0	,
0	were
0	rather
0	low
0	of
0	stature
0	,
0	with
0	round
0	chubby
0	faces
0	,
0	and
0	high
0	cheek

0	.

0	This
0	pond
0	was
0	connected
0	,
0	within
0	the
0	bushes
0	,
0	with
0	a
0	range
0	of
0	stagnant
0	,
0	muddy
0	waters
0	,
0	for
0	more
0	than
0	a
0	mile
0	or
0	two
0	,
0	along
0	the
0	plain
0	opposite
0	the
0	harbour
0	.

0	It
0	was
0	the
0	23d
0	before
0	the
0	Governor
0	and
0	officers
0	arrived
0	at
0	Paratounka
0	,
0	in
0	the
0	vicinage
0	of
0	which
0	the
0	priest
0	resided
0	,
0	of
0	whom
0	we
0	have
0	already
0	spoken
0	.

0	Its
0	Western
0	and
0	Northern
0	limits
0	were
0	first
0	discovered
0	in
0	1616
0	and
0	the
0	following
0	years
0	,
0	by
0	the
0	Dutch
0	navigators
0	,
0	when
0	a
0	noble
0	spirit
0	of
0	discovery
0	still
0	animated
0	the
0	governors
0	of
0	their
0	Indian
0	settlements
0	.

0	Other
0	fire-works
0	it
0	was
0	found
0	dangerous
0	to
0	exhibit
0	,
0	as
0	these
0	had
0	already
0	struck
0	the
0	spectators
0	,
PERSON-B	the
PERSON-I	King
0	as
0	well
0	as
0	his
0	people
0	,
0	with
0	a
0	general
0	panic
0	.

0	They
0	had
0	each
0	a
0	long
0	spear
0	in
0	his
0	hand
0	,
0	which
0	,
0	on
0	boarding
0	the
0	Discovery
0	,
0	they
0	delivered
0	to
0	the
0	Officer
0	on
0	the
0	deck
0	,
0	and
0	then
0	departed
0	.

0	Though
0	the
0	bucket
0	with
0	the
0	water
0	was
0	suspended
0	,
0	that
0	it
0	might
0	be

0	still
0	moved
0	to
0	and
0	fro
0	'
0	,
0	so
0	that
0	this
0	first
0	convinced
0	me
0	,
0	that
0	these
0	luminous
0	atoms
0	had
0	a
0	voluntary
0	motion
0	,
0	quite
0	independent
0	of
0	the

0	,
0	with

0	,
0	endeavoured
0	to
0	seize

0	We

0	charmed

0	it
0	,
0	observing

0	,
0	that
0	we

0	the

0	,
0	by

0	ourselves
0	already
0	in

0	At

0	In

0	the

0	As

0	,
0	though
0	much
0	against

0	of
PERSON-B	Capt.
PERSON-I	Cook

0	,
0	upon

0	first
0	arrival
0	of
0	the

0	upon
0	the

0	wished

0	prohibited
0	all
0	commerce
0	with
0	the

0	of
0	the

0	;

0	All
0	this
0	was
0	readily
0	complied
0	with

0	and
0	the
0	procession
0	began
0	about
0	ten
0	in
0	the
0	morning
0	,
0	when
0	minute
0	guns
0	from

0	,
0	muffled

0	On
0	the
0	31st
0	,
0	the

0	plyed

0	,
0	and
0	came
0	to
0	an

0	in
0	16
0	fathom
0	water
0	,
0	and
0	found
0	the
0	ebb
0	already
0	begun
0	.

0	Saw
0	several
0	birds
0	of
0	a
0	brown
0	plumage
0	hovering
0	about
0	the
0	ships
0	,
0	driven

0	by
0	the

0	+
0	ning
0	and
0	rain
0	,
0	which
0	blew
0	in
0	heavy
0	squalls
0	.

0	We
0	saw
0	no

0	of
0	knowledge
0	in
0	the

0	;

0	They
0	were
0	highly
0	delighted
0	with
0	the
0	music
0	,
0	and
0	would
0	not
0	suffer
0	the

0	to

0	a

0	.

0	Next
0	day
0	both
0	Captains
0	,
0	accompanied
0	with

0	,
0	went
0	to
0	pay
PERSON-B	the

0	a

0	on
0	shore
0	.

0	In
0	South-georgia
0	and
0	Sandwich-land
0	,
0	we
0	met
0	with
0	no
0	springs
0	:
0	but
0	as
0	there
0	is
0	ice
0	enough
0	in

0	and
0	even
0	as

0	as
0	the

0	of

0	°
0	South
0	latitude
0	,
0	in

0	and
0	in

0	of

0	higher

0	in
0	67
0	°
0	and
0	70
0	°
0	,
0	a

0	cannot

0	at
0	a

0	for

0	water
0	in
0	high
0	Southern
0	latitudes
0	.

0	They
0	then
0	searched
0	forwards
0	,
0	where
0	they
0	found
0	the
0	coal-hole
0	six
0	feet
0	deep
0	in
0	water
0	,
0	and
0	the
0	ship
0	's
0	whole
0	complement
0	of
0	paint
0	destroyed
0	;

0	At
0	the
0	close
0	of
0	the
0	evening
0	,
0	as
0	soon
0	as
0	it
0	was
0	dark
0	,
0	a
0	canoe
0	was
0	heard
0	paddling
0	towards
0	the
0	Resolution
0	,
0	in
0	which
0	were
0	two
0	men
0	.

0	They
0	paddled
0	round
0	the
0	ships
0	several
0	times
0	,
0	as
0	if
0	led
0	by
0	curiosity
0	;

0	and
0	then
0	they
0	are
0	piled
0	up
0	on
0	the
0	quarter-deck
0	,
0	where
0	the
0	salt-water
0	,
0	adhering
0	to
0	its
0	outside
0	,
0	soon
0	drains
0	away
0	;

0	6
0	of
0	the
0	1st
0	quarter
0	,
0	which
0	serves
0	to
0	bring
0	the
0	water
0	of
0	the
0	ocean
0	up
0	from
0	any
0	given
0	depth
0	:
0	they
0	ought
0	also
0	to
0	be
0	provided
0	with
0	an

0	and
0	nice
0	hydrostatical
0	balance
0	,
0	in

0	ascertain
0	the

0	of
0	any
0	water
0	or
0	liquid
0	;

0	Soon
0	after
0	day-light
0	,
0	we
0	were
0	within
0	the
0	light-house
0	near
0	the
0	entrance
0	of
0	the
0	harbour
0	,
0	but
0	were
0	opposed
0	by
0	a
0	strong
0	tide
0	from
0	the
0	shore
0	,
0	which
0	drifting
0	huge
0	pieces
0	of
0	floating
0	ice
0	against
0	us
0	,
0	made
0	our
0	further
0	progress
0	both
0	dangerous
0	and
0	fatiguing
0	but
0	,
0	having
0	the
0	wind
0	fair
0	,
0	about
0	five
0	in
0	the
0	evening
0	we
0	came
0	to
0	in
0	sight
0	of
0	the
0	town
0	,
0	and
0	soon
0	after
0	dropt
0	anchor
0	near
0	the
0	Resolution
0	.

0	Lat.
0	obs
0	.

0	they
0	were
0	so
0	very
0	obliging
0	,
0	that
0	,
0	seeing
0	us
0	in
0	want
0	of
0	wood
0	to
0	burn
0	,
0	they
0	made
0	an
0	offer
0	of
0	a
0	high
0	fence
0	,
0	that
0	surrounded
0	the
0	Morai
0	,
0	adjoining
0	to
0	the
0	town
0	,
0	for
0	a
0	present
0	supply
0	.

0	but
0	they
0	will
0	suffer
0	little
0	boys
0	to
0	handle
0	and
0	halter
0	them

0	which
0	is
0	done
0	by
0	passing
0	a
0	rope
0	through
0	a
0	hole
0	made
0	in
0	their
0	nostrils
0	,
0	and
0	round
0	their
0	horns
0	;

0	but
0	were
0	detained
0	in
0	the
0	bay
0	till
0	The
0	15th
0	,
0	when
0	we
0	were
0	alarmed
0	with
0	a
0	noise
0	louder
0	than
0	the
0	loudest
0	thunder
0	,
0	and
0	presently
0	were
0	almost
0	blinded
0	with
0	the
0	fall
0	of
0	ashes
0	,
0	which
0	in
0	less
0	than
0	an
0	hour
0	,
0	covered
0	the
0	decks
0	all
0	over
0	from
0	stern
0	to
0	stern
0	,
0	an
0	inch
0	thick
0	;

0	By
0	putting
0	one
0	under
0	the
0	microscope
0	,
0	we
0	observed
0	first
0	a
0	kind
0	of
0	thin
0	tube
0	going
0	into
0	the
0	substance
0	of
0	this
0	little
0	globule
0	,
0	from
0	a
0	round
0	orifice
0	on
0	its
0	surface
0	.

0	And
0	I
0	observed
0	very
0	frequently
0	,
0	in
0	the
0	years
0	1772
0	and
0	1773
0	,
0	when
0	we
0	were
0	amongst
0	the
0	ice
0	,
0	masses
0	which
0	had
0	the
0	most
0	evident
0	marks
0	of
0	such
0	a
0	formation
0	,
0	being
0	composed
0	of
0	strata
0	of
0	some
0	feet
0	in
0	thickness
0	.

0	This
0	diffused
0	a
0	joy
0	among
0	the
0	mariners
0	that
0	is
0	not
0	easy
0	to
0	be
0	expressed
0	.

0	He
0	then
0	returned
0	quite
0	exhausted
0	and
0	dejected
0	,
0	and
0	breaking
0	through
0	the
0	sedge
0	of
0	the
0	margin
0	of
0	the
0	lake
0	,
0	he
0	stumbled
0	upon
0	the
0	skeleton
0	of
0	the
0	monster
0	already
0	mentioned
0	,
0	which
0	he
0	believed
0	was
0	fifty
0	feet
0	long
0	.

0	which
0	certainly
0	is
0	very
0	considerable
0	,
0	and
0	makes
0	it
0	more
0	than
0	probably
0	,
0	that
0	the
0	ocean
0	is
0	frozen
0	in
0	winter
0	,
0	in
0	high
0	Northern
0	latitudes
0	,
0	even
0	as
0	far
0	as
0	the
0	Pole
0	.

0	but
0	instead
0	of
0	dispersing
0	,
0	they
0	now
0	made
0	a
0	general
0	attack
0	,
0	and
0	though
0	the
0	marines
0	fired
0	one
0	round
0	with
0	great
0	effect
0	,
0	the
0	crowd
0	was
0	not
0	intimidated
0	,
0	but
0	rushed
0	on
0	with
0	such
0	rapidity
0	,
0	that
0	there
0	was
0	no

0	.

0	When

0	in
0	this

0	into
0	a

0	,
0	it
0	appeared
0	luminous
0	,
0	where

0	only
0	to
0	the

0	or

0	,
0	which
0	agitated
0	the

0	and
0	having

0	,
0	that
0	his

0	stood

0	,
0	upon

0	,
0	would
0	crumble
0	into

0	.

0	On
0	the
0	morning
0	of
0	the
0	2d
0	,
0	some
0	parts
0	of
0	the
0	sea
0	seemed
0	covered
0	with
0	a

0	of
0	slime
0	,
0	and
0	myriads
0	of
0	small
0	sea
0	animals
0	were
0	seen
0	swimming
0	about
0	,
0	which
0	they

0	ease
0	upon

0	sides

0	or

0	probably
0	used

0	sledges
0	,
0	for
0	sledges
0	they
0	had
0	in

0	This
0	was

0	by

0	,
0	and
0	Trecher
0	mounted
0	the
0	loftiest
0	within
0	his

0	,
0	from

0	he
0	said
0	he

0	towards
0	the
0	South-west
0	,
0	a
0	hill
0	of
0	considerable
0	height
0	;

0	It
0	is
0	likewise
0	a
0	well
0	established
0	fact
0	,
0	that
0	the
0	ocean
0	,
0	itself
0	after
0	a
0	long
0	continued
0	calm
0	,
0	becomes
0	stinking
0	and
0	highly
0	putrid
0	,
0	×
0	arising
0	probably
0	from
0	the
0	putrefaction
0	of
0	a
0	great
0	many
0	animal
0	substances
0	,
0	that
0	die
0	in

0	days
0	frequently
0	and
0	suddenly
0	putrefy
0	.

0	On
0	shingly
0	beaches
0	I
0	have
0	,
0	though
0	seldom
0	,
0	found
0	a
0	few
0	black
0	smooth
0	stones
0	of
0	the
0	flinty
0	order
0	,
0	and
0	some

0	ponderous
0	,
0	speckled
0	grey
0	or
0	blackish
0	green

0	employed

0	to
0	form
0	their
0	emittees
0	,
0	or
0	weapons
0	for
0	close
0	engagement
0	.

0	It
0	remains
0	now
0	only
0	to
0	give
0	a
0	short
0	description
0	of
0	the
0	bay
0	and
0	harbour
0	where
0	we
0	repaired
0	,
0	which
0	at
0	the
0	entrance
0	is
0	between
0	two
0	very
0	high
0	bluff
0	rocks
0	.

0	Some
0	groups
0	of
0	the
0	finest
0	trees
0	and
0	flowering
0	shrubs
0	,
0	together
0	with
0	the
0	impending
0	venerable
0	rocks
0	from
0	whence
0	the
0	water
0	issued
0	,
0	involved
0	it
0	in
0	a
0	constant
0	shade
0	,
0	and
0	preserved
0	a
0	delicious
0	coolness
0	.

0	But
0	there
0	may
0	perhaps
0	be
0	other
0	methods
0	to
0	obviate
0	this
0	defect
0	,
0	of
0	which
0	our
0	narrow
0	knowledge
0	and
0	experience
0	have
0	not
0	yet
0	informed

0	.

0	The

0	were
0	then
0	ordered
0	out
0	,
0	and
0	sent
0	to
PLACE-B	Macao
0	for

0	provisions
0	,
0	which
0	next

0	were
0	dealt

0	In
0	their
0	search
0	they
0	found
0	something
0	like
0	an

0	mansion
0	,
0	being
0	a
0	deep
0	pit
0	sunk

0	hole
0	to
0	creep

0	about

0	square
0	.

0	A
0	Suspicion

0	,
0	*
0	of
0	a

0	founded
0	on
0	the

0	that
0	in

0	should
0	be
0	no
0	more
0	land

0	than
0	what

0	to
0	counterpoise
0	the
0	weight
0	of

0	in
0	the
0	Northern
0	.

0	It
0	was
0	now
0	three

PERSON-I	de

0	that

0	a

0	by

0	one
0	of

0	,

0	The
0	same

0	,

0	,
0	seems

0	Another
0	circumstance
0	worthy
0	of

0	,
0	that

0	The

0	much
0	concentrated
0	by

0	,
0	that
0	it
0	is
0	no
0	wonder
0	the

0	formed
0	in
0	it
0	,
0	became
0	at

0	brackish
0	:
0	it
0	should
0	seem

0	,
0	that
0	no

0	be
0	drawn

0	their

0	On

0	about

0	while

0	that
0	view
0	,
0	he
0	,
0	the

0	next
0	day
0	,
0	sent
0	an

0	to

0	at

0	and
0	on

0	it
0	was
0	judged
0	more

0	,
0	as
0	well
0	as
0	more
0	suitable
0	to
0	the

0	,
0	for
PERSON-B	Capt.
PERSON-I	Gore
0	,
0	our

0	,
0	and
0	Lieut
0	.

0	His

0	,
0	and
0	were
0	no

0	successful
0	than
0	the

0	;

0	Before
0	noon
0	,
0	the
0	wind
0	subsided
0	,
0	but
0	the
0	rain
0	continued
0	till
0	evening
0	,
0	of
0	which
0	we
0	made
0	good
0	use
0	.

0	but
0	after

0	,
0	were
0	as

0	and

0	as
0	the

0	of

0	.

0	but
0	seeing
0	the
0	fire
0	lighted
0	on
0	the
0	hill
0	in
0	the
0	evening
0	,
0	it
0	encouraged

0	to
0	make
0	one
0	struggle
0	more
0	for
0	life
0	.

0	A
0	ruffian
0	making
0	a
0	stroke
0	at
PERSON-B	Capt.
PERSON-I	Cook
0	,
0	was
0	shot
0	dead
0	by
0	the

0	himself
0	,
0	who
0	,
0	having
0	a

0	,
0	was
0	aiming
0	at

0	when
0	a

0	came
0	behind
0	him
0	,
0	and
0	striking
0	him
0	on
0	the
0	head
0	with
0	his
0	club
0	,
0	felled
0	him
0	to
0	the
0	ground
0	;

0	He
0	was
0	observed
0	to
0	have
0	a
0	small

0	tied
0	to
0	the

0	of
0	one
0	of

0	,
0	which

0	separated
0	with
0	great
0	care
0	,
0	and
0	reserved
0	for
0	himself
0	.

0	it
0	was
0	therefore
0	thought
0	necessary
0	to
0	strengthen
0	the
0	stanchions
0	and
0	rails
0	,
0	and
0	to

0	a

0	Sometimes
0	,
0	by
0	stirring
0	the
0	water
0	,
0	one
0	of
0	these
0	phosphoreal

0	would

0	The

0	to
0	correct
0	a
0	very

0	error
0	in
0	our

0	of
0	our
0	last

0	,
0	where
0	,
0	speaking
0	of
0	the
0	Russian
0	Discoveries
0	,
0	we
0	took
0	notice
0	,
0	after
0	examining
0	Beering
0	's
0	Straits
0	,
0	though
0	the
0	Russians
0	supposed
0	that
0	the
0	lands
0	were
0	parted
0	,
0	here
0	we
0	found
0	the
0	continent
0	to
0	join
0	,
0	by
0	which
0	the
0	Reader
0	will
0	,
0	no
0	doubt
0	,
0	imagine
0	,
0	that
0	we
0	have
0	asserted
0	,
0	that
0	the
0	two
0	continents
0	of
PLACE-B	Asia
0	and
PLACE-B	America
0	join
0	,
0	which
0	they
0	do
0	not
0	;

0	to
0	all
0	which
0	were
0	added
0	,
0	near
0	100
0	gallons
0	of
0	brandy
0	from
0	the
0	ships
0	stores
0	,
0	as
0	a
0	present
0	from
0	the
0	sailors
0	out
0	of
0	their
0	allowance
0	,
0	they
0	having
0	,
0	at
0	their
0	own
0	request
0	,
0	desired
0	that
0	so
0	much
0	should
0	be
0	spared
0	out
0	of
0	their
0	allowance
0	for
0	grog
0	,
0	in
0	lieu
0	of
0	the
0	tobacco
0	that
0	his
0	Excellency
0	had
0	generously
0	ordered
0	to
0	be
0	divided
0	amongst
0	them
0	gratis
0	;

0	They
0	had
0	some
0	instruments
0	for
0	fishing
0	,
0	which
0	we
0	did
0	not
0	observe
0	among
0	the
0	more
0	southerly
0	Indians
0	;

0	He
0	was
0	now
0	addressed
0	in
0	a
0	long
0	oration
0	by
0	a
0	priest
0	clothed
0	in
0	a
0	vestment
0	of
0	party-coloured
0	cloth
0	,
0	who
0	concluded
0	the
0	solemnity
0	with
0	a
0	choral
0	hymn
0	,
0	in
0	which
0	he
0	was
0	joined
0	by
0	all
0	the
0	priests
0	present
0	;

0	The
0	best
0	sort
0	was
0	certainly
0	scarce
0	,
0	and
0	it
0	should
0	seem
0	,
0	were
0	only
0	used
0	at
0	their
0	theatrical
0	exhibitions
0	,
0	or
0	other
0	solemnities
0	.

0	This
0	he
0	did
0	by
0	forming
0	wisps
0	of
0	grass
0	into
0	the
0	shape
0	of
0	soals
0	,
0	and
0	placing
0	them
0	underneath
0	the

0	pb
0	n
0	=

0	194

0	/
0	&gt;
0	soals
0	.

0	As
0	we
0	approached
0	it
0	,
0	we
0	observed
0	several
0	smokes
0	and
0	fires
0	a
0	considerable
0	way
0	within
0	land
0	.

0	Those
0	who
0	stood
0	ready
0	with
0	their
0	bows
0	and
0	arrows
0	,
0	had
0	their
0	spears
0	slung
0	over
0	their
0	right
0	shoulders
0	;

0	On
0	the
0	14th
0	,
0	a
0	vast
0	multitude
0	of
0	them
0	were
0	seen
0	together
0	,
0	making
0	great
0	lamentation
0	,
0	and
0	moving
0	slowly
0	along
0	to
0	the
0	beating
0	of
0	a
0	drum
0	,
0	that
0	scarce
0	gave
0	a
0	stroke
0	in
0	a
0	minute
0	.

0	But
0	the
0	least
0	addition
0	of
0	vegetation
0	enlivens
0	the
0	scene
0	,
0	and
0	even
0	the
0	slow
0	motions
0	of
0	unwieldy
0	and
0	torpid
0	seals
0	and
0	grave
0	pinguins
0	on
0	the
0	shore
0	,
0	infuse
0	life
0	and
0	chearfulness
0	into
0	the
0	beholder
0	.

0	The
0	method
0	we
0	took
0	was
0	always
0	to
0	slaughter
0	them
0	in
0	the
0	afternoon
0	,
0	and
0	as
0	soon
0	as
0	the
0	hair
0	was
0	scalded
0	off
0	,
0	and
0	the
0	entrails
0	removed
0	,
0	the
0	carcass
0	was
0	divided
0	into
0	pieces
0	,
0	from
0	four
0	to
0	eight
0	pounds
0	each
0	,
0	and
0	the
0	bones
0	of
0	the
0	chine
0	and
0	legs
0	taken
0	out
0	,
0	and
0	,
0	in
0	the

0	sort
0	,
0	the
0	ribs
0	also
0	.

0	steering

0	Thermometer

0	and
0	a

0	What
0	was
0	remarkable
0	,
0	though
0	the
0	sea
0	seemed
0	almost
0	covered
0	with
0	wild
0	ducks
0	,
0	and
0	sea-fowl
0	of
0	various
0	sorts
0	,
0	they
0	were
0	all
0	so
0	shy
0	,
0	that
0	very
0	few
0	were
0	killed
0	.

0	The
0	above-mentioned
0	shrimps
0	,
0	as
0	well

0	,
0	may
0	contribute
0	to
0	make
0	the
0	sea
0	appear
0	luminous
0	;

0	This
0	we
0	understood
0	they
0	did
0	,
0	to
0	show
0	that
0	they
0	had
0	no

0	Our

0	in

0	as
0	we
0	had
0	reason
0	to

0	from
0	the

0	they

0	passed
0	,
0	the

0	to
0	which
0	they
0	had
0	been
0	exposed
0	,
0	the

0	they
0	had
0	shipped
0	,
0	and
0	,
0	above
0	all
0	,
0	from
0	the
0	violent

0	of
0	the

0	that
0	had
0	shaken

0	being
0	likewise
0	plentifully
0	provided
0	with

0	The

0	we

0	On
0	the
0	24th
0	,
0	we
0	met
0	with
0	a
0	dreadful
0	tempest
0	of
0	wind
0	,
0	rain
0	,
0	and
0	hail
0	,
0	or
0	rather
0	ice
0	,
0	between
0	two
0	and
0	three
0	inches
0	square
0	,
0	by
0	which
0	several
0	of
0	our
0	men
0	,
0	who
0	were
0	obliged
0	to
0	keep
0	the
0	deck
0	,
0	were
0	severely
0	wounded
0	.

PERSON-B	Capt.
PERSON-I	Clerke
0	endeavoured
0	,
0	but
0	in
0	vain
0	,
0	to
0	enforce
0	the
0	order
0	,
0	and
0	the
0	matter
0	passed
0	on
0	without
0	any
0	serious
0	consequences
0	.

0	a
0	serjeant
0	,
0	two
0	sentinels
0	,
0	and
0	an
0	interpreter
0	allowed
0	for
0	their
0	domestics
0	.

0	and
0	as
0	our
0	people
0	were
0	now
0	put
0	on
0	two-thirds
0	allowance
0	,
0	what
0	each
0	caught
0	he
0	might
0	eat
0	or
0	sell
0	.

0	First
0	it
0	appears
0	that
0	the
0	beams
0	of
0	the
0	sun
0	falling
0	more
0	vertical
0	on
0	the
0	earth
0	,
0	cause
0	a
0	greater
0	degree
0	of
0	heat
0	,
0	and
0	in
0	proportion
0	as
0	they
0	fall
0	in
0	a
0	more
0	oblique
0	direction
0	,
0	they
0	produce
0	less
0	warmth
0	:
0	secondly
0	the
0	nearer
0	to
0	the
0	general
0	level
0	of
0	the
0	earth
0	,
0	the
0	more
0	is
0	the
0	atmosphere
0	heated
0	,
0	probably
0	the
0	beams
0	being
0	there
0	reflected
0	from
0	the
0	unequal
0	surface
0	of
0	the
0	earth
0	,
0	and
0	crossing
0	one
0	another
0	in
0	various
0	directions
0	cause
0	greater
0	warmth
0	;

0	We
0	coasted
0	along
0	the
0	N.
0	W.
0	side
0	of
0	the
0	island
0	,
0	sounding
0	as
0	we
0	went
0	,
0	while
0	the
0	boats
0	from
0	both
0	ships
0	were
0	employed
0	in
0	searching
0	for
0	some
0	bay
0	or
0	harbour
0	,
0	where
0	we
0	might
0	safely
0	anchor
0	.

0	The
0	high
0	Tropical
PLACE-B	Islands
0	are
0	either
0	surrounded
0	by
0	reefs
0	,
0	and
0	have
0	flats
0	near
0	the
0	sea-shore
0	,
0	or
0	they
0	are
0	without
0	reefs
0	.

0	The
0	weather
0	was
0	this
0	day
0	so
0	altered
0	,
0	that
0	the
0	gentlemen
0	who
0	delighted
0	in
0	the
0	sport
0	,
0	diverted
0	themselves
0	in
0	the
0	boats
0	with
0	shooting
0	ducks
0	,
0	shags
0	,
0	sea-larks
0	,
0	and
0	gulls
0	;

0	but
0	near
0	the
0	shore
0	there
0	were
0	shoals
0	of
0	sharks
0	,
0	and
0	the
0	sea
0	seemed
0	crusted
0	over
0	with
0	sea-fowls
0	,
0	some
0	of
0	a
0	very
0	large
0	size
0	.

0	Sixty
0	rubles
0	(
0	about
0	12
0	guineas
0	nearly
0	)
0	have
0	been
0	given
0	for
0	a
0	skin
0	,
0	and
0	a
0	sea-beaver
0	for
0	a
0	single
0	paw
0	.

0	Their
0	manufactures
0	the
0	people
0	freely
0	sold
0	for
0	nails
0	,
0	hatchets
0	,
0	scissars
0	,
0	knives
0	,
0	or
0	iron
0	instruments
0	of
0	any
0	kind
0	;

0	In
0	some
0	places
0	we
0	observed
0	large
0	and
0	high
0	cascades
0	,
0	which
0	greatly
0	contribute
0	to
0	soften
0	the
0	harshness
0	of
0	its
0	wild
0	scenery
0	.

0	and
0	the
0	more
0	so
0	,
0	as
0	the
0	valley
0	,
0	wherein
0	Matavai-river
0	runs
0	,
0	scarcely
0	extends
0	at
0	its
0	very
0	extremity
0	to
0	more
0	than
0	six
0	miles
0	,
0	and
0	this
0	valley
0	is
0	almost
0	at
0	the
0	same
0	distance
0	from
0	the
0	sea
0	,
0	with
0	the
0	highest
0	part
0	of
0	the
0	hill
0	.

0	The
0	smell
0	,
0	when
0	they
0	looked
0	down
0	,
0	was
0	enough
0	to
0	satisfy
0	them
0	.

0	9.6.
0	saw
0	a
0	sail
0	standing
0	to
0	the
0	Southward
0	,
0	when
0	we
0	made
0	the
0	Discover
0	•
0	…
0	'
0	s
0	signal
0	to
0	chace
0	;

0	Having
0	now
0	got
0	the
0	meal
0	on
0	board
0	,
0	the
0	crews
0	were
0	served
0	with
0	an
0	allowance
0	of
0	half
0	rye
0	and
0	half
0	flour
0	;

0	Of
0	the
0	repairs
0	,
0	the
0	Resolution
0	's
0	rudder
0	was
0	the
0	most
0	material
0	.

0	There
0	begins
0	the
0	sand
0	,
0	formed
0	in
0	some
0	places
0	from
0	small
0	shells
0	,
0	and
0	rubbed
0	pieces
0	of
0	coral
0	rock
0	;

0	and
0	,
0	between
0	the
0	rotten-stone
0	and
0	the
0	above-mentioned
0	sand-stone
0	,
0	is
0	a
0	stratum
0	containing
0	both
0	mixed
0	together
0	.

0	Besides
0	these
0	ponds
0	of
0	fresh
0	water
0	,
0	there
0	is
0	in
0	Namocka
0	a
0	large
0	lagoon
0	of
0	salt
0	water
0	about
0	three
0	miles
0	long
0	,
0	full
0	of
0	small
0	isles
0	,
0	beautifully
0	ornamented
0	with
0	clusters
0	of
0	trees
0	,
0	crowded
0	with
0	wild
0	ducks
0	,
0	and
0	surrounded
0	by
0	bushes
0	of
0	mangroves
0	and
0	hills
0	forming
0	a
0	romantic
0	landscape
0	.

0	With
0	that
0	view
0	,
0	and
0	that
0	view
0	only
0	,
0	the
0	Captain
0	said
0	he
0	came
0	to
0	request
PERSON-B	the
PERSON-I	King
0	to
0	place
0	confidence
0	in
0	him
0	,
0	and
0	to
0	make
0	his
0	ship
0	his
0	residence
0	,
0	as
0	the
0	most
0	effectual
0	means
0	of
0	putting
0	a
0	stop
0	to
0	the
0	robberies
0	that
0	were
0	now
0	daily
0	and
0	hourly
0	committed
0	and
0	committing
0	,
0	by
0	his
0	people
0	,
0	both
0	at
0	the
0	tents
0	and
0	on
0	board
0	the
0	ships
0	,
0	and
0	were
0	so
0	daring
0	as
0	to
0	become
0	insufferable
0	.

0	This
0	grass
0	is
0	perennial
0	,
0	and
0	bears
0	the
0	rigours
0	of
0	the
0	coldest
0	winters
0	:
0	it
0	grows
0	always
0	in
0	tufts
0	or
0	bunches
0	,
0	at
0	some
0	distance
0	from
0	each
0	other
0	.

0	which
0	certainly
0	proves
0	the
0	extreme
0	rigour
0	of
0	the
0	climate
0	,
0	as
0	the
0	line
0	of
0	eternal
0	snow
0	comes
0	down
0	so
0	low
0	.

0	The
0	sides
0	of
0	the
0	hills
0	,
0	which
0	I
0	visited
0	,
0	are
0	composed
0	of
0	a
0	yellow
0	ochreous
0	clay
0	,
0	richly
0	spangled
0	with
0	small
0	particles
0	of
0	cat-silver
0	,
0	or
0	a
0	whitish
0	kind
0	of
0	daze
0	(

0	The
0	country
0	is
0	said
0	to
0	abound
0	with
0	wild
0	beasts
0	,
0	which
0	constitute
0	the
0	principal
0	riches
0	of
0	the
0	inhabitants
0	;

0	and
0	to
0	observe
0	the
0	course
0	of
0	the
0	sun
0	for
0	his
0	guide
0	,
0	but
0	he
0	met
0	with
0	many
0	obstructions
0	that
0	retarded
0	his
0	progress
0	.

0	I
0	have
0	impartially
0	and
0	carefully
0	considered
0	and
0	examined
0	these
0	arguments
0	,
0	and
0	compared
0	every
0	circumstance
0	with
0	what
0	we
0	saw
0	in
0	the
0	high
0	Southern
0	latitudes
0	,
0	and
0	with
0	other
0	known
0	facts
0	,
0	and
0	will
0	here
0	insert
0	the
0	result
0	of
0	all
0	my
0	enquiries
0	on
0	this
0	subject
0	.

0	which
0	possibly
0	might
0	be
0	the
0	case
0	with
0	him
0	who
0	loaded
0	the
0	gun
0	,
0	as
0	the
0	sailors
0	in
0	general
0	could
0	hardly
0	be
0	restrained
0	from
0	violence
0	,
0	whenever
0	a
0	native
0	came
0	within
0	their
0	power
0	.

0	all
0	the
0	boats
0	were
0	accordingly
0	got
0	out
0	,
0	and
0	the
0	Commodore
0	went
0	on
0	board
0	the
0	Resolution
0	,
0	where
0	it
0	was
0	resolved
0	,
0	for
0	the
0	greater
0	convenience
0	of
0	repairing
0	the
0	ships
0	,
0	and
0	for
0	erecting
0	the
0	tents
0	and
0	forge
0	,
0	to
0	go
0	within
0	the
0	upper
0	harbour
0	.

0	On
0	the
0	morning
0	of
0	the
0	15th
0	,
0	our
0	great
0	cutter
0	,
0	which
0	was
0	moored
0	to
0	the
0	buoy
0	,
0	was
0	missing
0	from
0	her
0	moorings
0	,
0	and
0	,
0	upon
0	examination
0	,
0	the
0	boat
0	's
0	painter
0	was
0	found
0	cut
0	two
0	fathoms
0	from
0	the
0	buoy
0	,
0	and
0	the
0	remainder
0	of
0	the
0	rope
0	gone
0	with
0	the
0	boat
0	.

0	but
0	these
0	they
0	refused
0	to
0	exchange
0	for
0	any
0	thing
0	we
0	offered
0	.

0	The
0	argument
0	,
0	therefore
0	,
0	is
0	now
0	reduced
0	to
0	this
0	,
0	"
0	That
0	salt-water
0	does
0	not
0	freeze
0	at
0	all
0	,
0	or
0	,
0	if
0	it
0	does
0	,
0	the
0	ice
0	contains
0	briny
0	particles
0	.
0	"

0	Now
0	,
0	if
0	six
0	or
0	seven
0	degrees
0	of
0	latitude
0	,
0	containing
0	from
0	360
0	to
0	420
0	sea
0	miles
0	,
0	are
0	not
0	to
0	be
0	reckoned
0	a
0	great
0	distance
0	from
0	the
0	land
0	,
0	I
0	do
0	not
0	know
0	in
0	what
0	manner
0	to
0	argue
0	,
0	because
0	no
0	distance

0	will
0	be
0	reckoned
0	far
0	from
0	any

0	were

0	to
0	make
0	what

0	they
0	pleased
0	;

0	and
0	that

0	constantly
0	employed
0	night
0	and

0	in

0	They

0	,
0	and
0	knew
0	not

0	.

0	To

0	And
0	now
0	a

0	springing

0	we

0	We

0	it

0	,
0	the

0	acquainted
0	them
0	with

0	by
0	shewing

0	the

0	the

0	.

0	but
0	what
0	was
0	remarkable
0	,
0	they
0	had
0	no
0	out-riggers
0	to
0	prevent
0	their
0	oversetting
0	,
0	like

0	The

0	by

0	between
0	two

0	of
0	wood
0	fastened
0	to
0	a

0	.

0	We

0	the

0	About

0	of

0	we
0	stood
0	in

0	it
0	continues

0	but
0	with

0	caution
0	.

0	and
0	had

0	our
0	gentlemen
0	furnished
0	them
0	with
0	a
0	key
0	to
0	it
0	,
0	must
0	have
0	remained
0	perfectly
0	unintelligible
0	:
0	they

0	however
0	,
0	no
0	small
0	satisfaction
0	at
0	being
0	able
0	to
0	clear

0	the

0	with
0	which
0	too
0	the
0	Governor
0	was
0	no
0	less
0	pleased

0	instructed
0	.

0	yet
0	on
0	Christmas-day
0	,
0	when
0	each

0	and
0	free

0	as

0	liked
0	,
0	not
0	a

0	was
0	heard
0	;

0	When
0	they
0	thought
0	themselves
0	just
0	ready
0	to
0	mount
0	,
0	they
0	met
0	with
0	a
0	lagoon
0	that
0	interrupted
0	their
0	progress
0	;

0	The
PERSON-B	King
0	,
0	upon
0	this
0	remonstrance
0	,
0	was
0	preparing
0	to
0	comply
0	,
0	and
0	his
0	two
0	sons
0	were
0	actually
0	on
0	board
0	the
0	pinnace
0	to
0	accompany
PERSON-B	the

0	,
0	when
0	a

0	,
0	mother
0	to

0	,
0	and
0	a
0	great
0	favourite
0	of
PERSON-B	the
PERSON-I	King
0	's
0	,
0	came
0	after
0	them
0	,
0	and
0	,
0	with
0	many
0	tears
0	and
0	entreaties
0	,
0	besought
0	them
0	to
0	come
0	on
0	shore
0	and
0	not
0	to
0	go
0	on
0	board
0	the
0	ships
0	.

0	We
0	were
0	now
0	steering
0	with
0	a
0	fine
0	breeze
0	,
0	but
0	just
0	at
0	the
0	close
0	of
0	the
0	evening
0	,
0	to
0	our
0	great
0	mortification
0	,
0	the
0	wind
0	died
0	away
0	,
0	and
0	a
0	great
0	swell
0	succeeding
0	,
0	with
0	a
0	strong
0	current
0	setting
0	right
0	in
0	for
0	the
0	shore
0	,
0	we
0	were
0	in
0	the
0	utmost
0	danger
0	of
0	being
0	driven
0	upon
0	the
0	rocks
0	.

0	they
0	the
0	very
0	next
0	day
0	returned
0	to
0	business
0	,
0	and
0	continued
0	it
0	without

0	,
0	till
0	The
0	16th
0	of
0	January
0	,
0	1779
0	,
0	when
0	,
0	after
0	a
0	series
0	of
0	the
0	most
0	tempestuous
0	weather
0	that
0	ever
0	happened
0	in
0	that
0	climate
0	,
0	the
0	boats
0	from
0	both
0	ships
0	were
0	sent
0	out
0	to
0	examine
0	a
0	fine
0	bay
0	,
0	where
0	we
0	were
0	informed
0	there
0	was
0	a
0	harbour
0	in
0	which
0	we
0	might
0	safely
0	moor
0	,
0	and
0	where
0	we
0	should
0	be
0	supplied
0	with
0	materials
0	to
0	refit
0	the
0	ships
0	,
0	and
0	provisions
0	to
0	victual
0	them
0	.

0	During
0	the
0	night
0	there
0	was
0	an
0	eclipse
0	of
0	the
0	moon
0	,
0	but
0	could
0	not
0	be
0	observed
0	because
0	of
0	the
0	violent
0	rain
0	.

0	These
0	monsters
0	,
0	when
0	at
0	their
0	growth
0	,
0	are
0	in
0	length
0	from
0	the
0	head
0	to
0	the
0	hindmost
0	fin
0	from
0	eleven
0	to
0	twelve
0	feet
0	;

0	The
0	close
0	texture
0	of
0	these
0	plants
0	,
0	hinders
0	the
0	moisture
0	below
0	from
0	evaporating
0	,
0	and
0	thus
0	furnishes
0	nutriment
0	to
0	the
0	vegetation
0	above
0	,
0	and
0	clothes
0	at
0	last
0	whole
0	hills
0	and
0	isles
0	with
0	a
0	constant
0	verdure
0	.

0	In
0	the
0	evening
0	,
0	we
0	close
0	reefed
0	our
0	top-sails
0	,
0	and
0	within
0	half
0	an
0	hour
0	could
0	not
0	shew
0	an
0	inch
0	of
0	sail
0	,
0	except
0	fore
0	and
0	mizen
0	stay-sails
0	.

0	which
0	being
0	soon
0	missed
0	,
0	all
0	the
0	Indians
0	on
0	board
0	were
0	seized
0	,
0	their
0	boats
0	secured
0	and
0	searched
0	;

0	He
0	attempted
0	the
0	lagoon
0	,
0	and
0	waded
0	nearly
0	across
0	,
0	without
0	the
0	water
0	rising
0	higher
0	than
0	his
0	middle
0	,
0	but
0	all
0	at
0	once
0	plunged
0	over-head
0	in
0	deep
0	water
0	,
0	and
0	it
0	was
0	next
0	to
0	a
0	miracle
0	that
0	he
0	saved
0	himself
0	from
0	drowning
0	.

0	E.
0	but
0	whether
0	the
0	Ruffian
0	discoveries
0	had
0	reached
0	so
0	far
0	,
0	we
0	could
0	not
0	be
0	able
0	to
0	determine
0	:
0	that
0	the
0	inhabitants
0	were
0	no
0	strangers
0	to
0	the
0	use
0	of
0	iron
0	and
0	other
0	metals
0	was
0	,
0	as
0	has
0	already
0	been
0	observed
0	,
0	visible
0	on
0	our
0	first
0	approach
0	;

0	With
0	him
0	the
0	Governor
0	spent
0	the
0	afternoon
0	,
0	but
0	when
0	night
0	came
0	he
0	slept
0	at
0	the
0	fort
0	,
0	if
0	fort
0	a
0	mere
0	log-house
0	could
0	be
0	called
0	,
0	without
0	either
0	gun
0	or
0	platform
0	to
0	place
0	a
0	gun
0	.

0	it
0	is
0	evident
0	that
0	fresh
0	water
0	must
0	melt
0	the
0	ice
0	,
0	more
0	than
0	common
0	air
0	,
0	as
0	the
0	particles
0	of
0	water
0	in
0	contact
0	with
0	the
0	ice
0	are
0	so
0	much
0	heavier
0	;

0	but
0	when
0	they
0	saw
0	our
0	distress
0	,
0	and
0	that
0	we
0	only
0	meant
0	to
0	repair
0	our
0	ships
0	,
0	so
0	far
0	from
0	giving
0	us
0	any
0	disturbance
0	,
0	they
0	gave
0	us
0	every
0	assistance
0	in
0	their
0	power
0	.

0	The
0	surface
0	of
0	the
0	soil
0	is
0	a
0	clay
0	mixed
0	with
0	mould
0	,
0	which
0	the
0	natives
0	manure
0	with
0	shells
0	.

0	They
0	had
0	gloves
0	and
0	boots
0	likewise
0	of
0	their
0	own
0	manufacturing
0	,
0	and
0	cloaks
0	very
0	curiously
0	wrought
0	.

0	The
0	least
0	magnifier
0	of
0	my
0	microscope
0	discovered
0	these
0	little
0	atoms
0	to
0	be
0	globular
0	,
0	gelatinous
0	,
0	transparent
0	,
0	and
0	somewhat
0	brownish
0	.

0	In
0	the
0	winter
0	they
0	use
0	the
0	balagans
0	for
0	magazines
0	,
0	the
0	thatch
0	secures
0	what
0	they
0	lay
0	up
0	in
0	them
0	from
0	rain
0	,
0	and
0	by
0	taking
0	away
0	the
0	ladder
0	,
0	it
0	becomes
0	inaccessible

0	We
0	close
0	reefed

0	to
0	some

0	hints
0	concerning

0	they

0	of
0	the

0	,
0	and
0	they

0	helping

0	to
0	compleat

0	The
0	only
0	part
0	of
0	the
0	performance
0	that
0	was
0	tolerable
0	,
0	was
0	their
0	singing
0	,
0	with
0	which
0	the
0	heiva
0	or
0	play
0	concluded
0	;

0	Several
0	of
0	the

0	came
0	on

0	,
0	who
0	were
0	so
0	immoderately
0	fond
0	of
0	iron
0	,
0	that
0	they
0	endeavoured
0	to
0	wrench
0	the
0	very
0	ring-bolts
0	from
0	the
0	hatches
0	.

0	and
0	happily
0	it
0	was
0	that

0	got
0	safe
0	into
0	harbour
0	,
0	for
0	a

0	arose
0	,
0	which
0	tumbled
0	the
0	waters
0	into
0	the
0	race
0	with
0	unexampled
0	fury
0	.

0	I
0	suppose
0	,
0	however
0	,
0	that
0	this
0	happens
0	always
0	during
0	calms
0	,
0	which
0	are
0	not
0	uncommon
0	in
0	high
0	latitudes
0	,
0	as
0	we
0	experienced
0	in
0	the
0	late
0	expedition
0	.

0	and
0	to
0	enable
0	those
0	who
0	were
0	to
0	be
0	sent
0	on
0	that
0	errand
0	the
0	better
0	to
0	direct
0	their
0	search
0	,
0	the
0	gentlemen
0	described
0	,
0	as
0	well
0	as
0	they
0	could
0	,
0	the
0	spot
0	where
0	they
0	thought
0	they
0	heard
0	men
0	halloo
0	to
0	one
0	another
0	about
0	the
0	dawn
0	of
0	day
0	.

0	The
0	gentlemen
0	were
0	not
0	more
0	gratified

0	,
0	the

0	being
0	a

0	we
0	observed

0	under
0	a
0	high
0	part
0	of
0	the
0	island
0	,
0	lying
0	with

0	upon
0	the

0	the
0	sail

0	reason
0	to
0	suppose
0	that

0	in

0	,
0	which
0	are
0	subject
0	to

0	,
0	will
0	find
0	nothing
0	extraordinary
0	or
0	difficult
0	in
0	this
0	argument
0	:
0	for
0	it
0	is
0	a
0	well-known
0	fact
0	in
0	cold
0	countries
0	,
0	that
0	the
0	ice
0	,
0	which
0	covers
0	their
0	lakes
0	and
0	rivers
0	,
0	is
0	often
0	opaque
0	,

0	when
0	the
0	frost
0	sets
0	in
0	,
0	accompanied
0	by
0	a

0	We
0	know
0	very

0	of
0	a
0	ship
0	through
0	the

0	in
0	a

0	swift
0	,
0	and
0	the
0	friction
0	caused
0	by
0	this
0	motion
0	very
0	great
0	:
0	for
0	we
0	find
0	that
0	the
0	sea
0	agitated
0	by
0	a
0	gale
0	of
0	wind
0	is
0	remarkably
0	warmer

0	into

0	the

0	in

0	which
0	they
0	accordingly
0	did
0	,
0	bringing
0	with
0	them
0	the
0	very
0	same
0	forts
0	of
0	skins
0	which
0	we
0	had
0	purchased
0	of
0	the

0	at

0	made
0	of
0	iron
0	,

0	The

0	about

0	About

0	flame
0	ascend
0	from
0	a
0	burning

0	,
0	and
0	observed

0	At

0	obliged
0	to

0	.

0	We
0	now

0	efforts

0	it

0	obvious
0	that
0	the
0	concentrated
0	briny
0	parts
0	ran
0	out
0	and
0	were
0	entirely
0	drained
0	from
0	the

0	,
0	which
0	was
0	formed
0	of
0	the
0	fresh
0	water
0	only
0	.

0	and
0	seeing
0	the
0	land
0	trend
0	away
0	to
0	the
0	N.
0	W.
0	we
0	directed
0	our
0	course
0	accordingly
0	,
0	till
0	,
0	having
0	doubled
0	the

0	our

0	In

0	,
0	the
0	utmost

0	was
0	made
0	to
0	hasten
0	our
0	departure
0	,
0	so
0	that
0	by
0	the
0	latter
0	end
0	of
0	September
0	we
0	were
0	in
0	readiness
0	to
0	put
0	to
0	sea
0	.

0	and
0	so
0	disfigured
0	and
0	tormented
0	with
0	their
0	bites
0	and
0	blisters
0	,
0	that
0	it
0	is
0	hardly
0	possible
0	to
0	desribe
0	their

0	.

0	but
0	our
0	gentlemen
0	were
0	much
0	disappointed
0	,
0	who
0	went
0	in
0	pursuit
0	of
0	them
0	.

0	Their
0	language
0	differed
0	but
0	little
0	from
0	that
0	of
0	every
0	other
0	people
0	we
0	had
0	lately
0	visited
0	;

0	and
0	that
0	in
0	all
0	instances
0	,
0	the

0	between
0	the
0	temperature
0	at
0	top
0	and
0	at
0	100

0	exceeded
0	4

0	,
0	of

0	thermometer
0	,
0	or
0	that
0	the
0	temperature
0	of
0	the
0	air
0	did
0	not
0	differ
0	five
0	degrees
0	from
0	that
0	of
0	the

0	at
0	100

0	.

0	But
0	what
0	is
0	most
0	remarkable
0	,
0	and
0	deserves
0	the
0	attention
0	of
0	the
0	curious
0	,
0	is
0	the
0	general
0	conformity
0	between
0	the
0	Kamshatskadales
0	towards
0	the
0	East
0	,
0	and
0	of
0	the
0	Americans
0	,
0	that
0	live
0	on
0	the
0	opposite
0	coast
0	,
0	just
0	over
0	against

0	their

0	,
0	habits
0	,
0	customs
0	,
0	and
0	food
0	;

0	In
0	it
0	they
0	found
0	the
0	bones
0	of
0	dried
0	fish
0	,
0	and
0	of
0	birds
0	,
0	and
0	near
0	it
0	a

0	where
0	there
0	had
0	been
0	a

0	,
0	but
0	all
0	had
0	the
0	appearance
0	of
0	being
0	long
0	deserted
0	.

0	this
0	is
0	a
0	wonder
0	which
0	fills
0	the
0	mind
0	with
0	greater
0	astonishment
0	and
0	reverential

0	,
0	than
0	it

0	I
0	believe
0	the

0	was

0	,
0	because
0	the

0	,
0	caused
0	a
0	great
0	evaporation
0	,
0	which
0	cooled
0	the
0	air
0	:
0	and
0	we
0	were
0	likewise
0	every
0	where
0	surrounded
0	by
0	large
0	ice-masses
0	,
0	which
0	had

0	cooled
0	the

0	all
0	round
0	,
0	that
0	it
0	remained
0	in

0	On
0	the

0	our

0	for

0	what
0	the

0	.

0	and
0	I
0	must
0	confess
0	,
0	that
0	though
0	I
0	had
0	read
0	a
0	great
0	many
0	accounts
0	on
0	their
0	nature
0	,
0	figure
0	,

0	,
0	I
0	was
0	however
0	very
0	much
0	struck
0	by

0	.

0	The

0	continuing

0	for

0	,
0	heavy
0	complaints
0	again
0	prevailed
0	among

0	.

0	They
0	forgot
0	,
0	for
0	the
0	moment
0	,
0	the
0	pains
0	of
0	their
0	lacerated

0	all
0	torn
0	with

0	Before

0	In

0	c
0	.

0	the
0	day
0	was
0	pleasant

0	and
0	he
0	had
0	a

0	From
0	this

0	it

0	who

0	We
0	therefore
0	kept
0	at
0	a
0	convenient

0	,
0	and
0	opened

0	Before

0	to

0	On

0	as
0	we
0	advanced

0	and
0	the

0	We
0	tacked
0	,
0	and
0	stood

0	till
0	the
0	morning
0	of

0	he
0	therefore
0	took

0	drawn
0	according
0	to
0	the

0	and
0	were

0	This
0	was
0	on

0	to

0	where

0	told
0	there
0	was

0	but
0	,
0	on

0	of

0	,
0	there
0	was

0	The

0	serve
0	the

0	at

0	in
0	jumping
0	from
0	one

0	to

0	,
0	and
0	sometimes

0	a

0	on

0	.

0	What
0	is
0	still
0	more
0	remarkable
0	,
0	this
0	happened
0	in
0	isles
0	surrounded
0	by
0	the
0	moist
0	and
0	therefore
0	mild
0	sea
0	air
0	,
0	which
0	undoubtedly
0	weakens
0	the

0	of

0	,
0	and
0	commonly
0	mitigates
0	the

0	.

0	Soon
0	as
0	day
0	began
0	to
0	dawn
0	,
0	he
0	found
0	himself
0	weak
0	and
0	languid
0	,
0	and
0	had
0	very
0	little
0	stomach
0	to

0	.

0	Every

0	that

0	;

0	On
0	the

0	,
0	we
0	crossed
0	the

0	,
0	and
0	observed
0	a

0	to

0	at

0	great

PERSON-B	the

0	and

0	,
0	to

0	,

0	the
0	towns
0	,
0	of
0	which
0	there
0	were
0	two
0	,
0	one
0	on
0	each
0	side
0	the
0	bay
0	,
0	they
0	concluded
0	that
0	our
0	design
0	was
0	to
0	seize
0	their
0	marine
0	.

0	On
0	the
0	18th
0	both
0	ships
0	were
0	again
0	warped
0	near
0	the
0	shore
0	,
0	and
0	a
0	spring
0	put
0	upon
0	their
0	cables
0	,
0	in
0	order
0	to
0	cover
0	the

0	which
0	were
0	sent
0	to
0	compleat
0	our
0	complement
0	of
0	water
0	.

0	These
0	were
0	warmly
0	clothed
0	with
0	cloaks
0	of
0	valuable
0	furs
0	,
0	that
0	reached
0	down
0	to
0	their
0	ancles
0	;

0	their
0	coppers
0	for
0	boiling
0	the
0	oil
0	,
0	with
0	the
0	small
0	ware
0	with
0	which
0	they
0	trafficked
0	with
0	the
0	natives
0	by
0	way
0	of
0	exchange
0	.

0	the
0	men
0	threw
0	off
0	their
0	war-mats
0	;

0	He
0	had
0	got
0	out
0	of
0	the
0	thicket
0	,
0	and
0	was
0	wandering
0	about
0	upon
0	the
0	beech
0	,
0	without
0	being
0	sensible
0	of
0	the
0	miserable
0	condition
0	in
0	which
0	he
0	was
0	found
0	.

0	As
0	rest
0	was
0	now
0	no
0	longer
0	their
0	object
0	,
0	they
0	rose
0	and
0	wandered
0	,
0	they
0	neither
0	knew
0	nor
0	cared
0	where
0	,
0	till
0	day
0	began
0	to
0	break
0	upon
0	them
0	.

0	among
0	which
0	were
0	mixed
0	pumice-stones
0	as
0	large
0	as
0	walnuts
0	,
0	and
0	many
0	smaller
0	stones
0	,
0	which
0	seemed
0	to
0	have
0	received
0	no
0	alteration
0	by
0	fire
0	.

0	They
0	have
0	vultures
0	also
0	,
0	and
0	hawks
0	innumerable
0	.

0	but
0	there
0	is
0	not
0	the
0	least
0	appearance
0	that
0	this
0	opinion
0	is
0	well
0	founded
0	,
0	and
0	probably
0	it
0	has
0	been
0	adopted
0	by
0	voyagers
0	on
0	no
0	other
0	account
0	,
0	than
0	because
0	they
0	found
0	ice
0	in
0	a
0	latitude
0	,
0	where
0	it
0	is
0	seldom
0	or
0	ever
0	to
0	be
0	met
0	with
0	in
0	our
0	Northern
0	seas
0	;

0	In
0	the
0	evening
0	,
0	parties
0	from
0	both
0	ships
0	were
0	invited
0	to
0	go
0	a
0	turtling
0	,
0	but
0	none
0	were
0	pressed
0	into
0	that
0	service
0	,
0	all
0	were
0	volunteers
0	.

0	In
0	the
0	night
0	saw
0	volumes
0	of
0	flame
0	proceeding
0	from
0	it
0	,
0	very
0	awful
0	.

0	and
0	the
0	water
0	being
0	alone
0	volatile
0	,
0	rises
0	in
0	steams
0	,
0	and
0	is
0	distilled
0	.

0	We
0	were
0	now
0	so
0	far
0	advanced
0	to
0	the
0	Northward
0	and
0	Eastward
0	,
0	as
0	to
0	have
0	reached
0	that
0	void
0	space
0	in
0	our
0	maps
0	,
0	which
0	is
0	marked
0	as
0	a
0	country
0	unknown
0	.

0	But
0	when
0	the
0	surface
0	of
0	a
0	land
0	is
0	clad
0	with
0	plants
0	and
0	diversified
0	with
0	birds
0	and
0	animals
0	,
0	then
0	first
0	we
0	have
0	an
0	idea
0	of
0	the
0	vivifying
0	powers
0	of
0	nature
0	and
0	its
0	great
0	Lord
0	.

0	these
0	colours
0	appeared
0	most
0	vivid
0	,
0	when
0	the
0	glass
0	into
0	which
0	these
0	animalcula
0	were
0	placed
0	,
0	was
0	held
0	to
0	a
0	strong
0	light
0	,
0	but
0	had
0	only
0	a
0	brownish
0	cast
0	when
0	the
0	animals
0	had
0	subsided
0	to
0	the
0	bottom
0	.

0	The
0	natives
0	continued
0	their
0	visits
0	,
0	and
0	besides
0	fish
0	,
0	furs
0	,
0	and
0	venison
0	,
0	brought
0	bladders
0	of
0	oil
0	,
0	which
0	were
0	greedily
0	purchased
0	by
0	the
0	men
0	.

0	such
0	as
0	primroses
0	,
0	violets
0	,
0	currants
0	,
0	rasberries
0	,
0	juniper
0	,
0	and
0	many
0	other
0	Northern
0	fruits
0	,
0	which
0	were
0	now
0	all
0	in
0	blossom
0	.

0	This
0	gave
0	cause
0	to
0	suspect
0	that
0	some
0	villainy
0	was
0	concerting
0	;

0	but
0	we
0	afterwards
0	understood
0	they
0	were
0	come
0	to
0	attack
0	a
0	body
0	of
0	their
0	enemies
0	on
0	the
0	opposite
0	shore
0	,
0	whom
0	they
0	afterwards
0	engaged
0	,
0	and
0	returned
0	victorious
0	.

0	and
0	vice
0	versa
0	machines
0	and
0	experiments
0	executed
0	upon
0	a
0	small
0	scale
0	will
0	not
0	produce
0	the
0	effect
0	,
0	which
0	they
0	certainly
0	have
0	when
0	made
0	in
0	a
0	more
0	enlarged
0	manner
0	.

PERSON-B	Mr.
PERSON-I	Nelson
0	,
0	and
0	his
0	associates
0	found
0	,
0	on
0	this
0	island
0	,
0	great
0	quantities
0	of
0	wild
0	celery
0	,
0	and
0	a
0	kind
0	of
0	wild
0	vetch
0	or
0	chichling
0	,
0	of
0	which
0	the
0	ship
0	's
0	company
0	made
0	the
0	proper
0	use
0	.

0	Under
0	the
0	tropicks
0	,
0	the
0	atmosphere
0	and
0	surface
0	of
0	the
0	earth
0	is
0	more
0	heated
0	than
0	towards
0	the
0	poles
0	,
0	because
0	the
0	sun
0	operates
0	at
0	the
0	first
0	place
0	more
0	vertically
0	,
0	and
0	at
0	the
0	other
0	more
0	obliquely
0	,
0	and
0	therefore
0	less
0	effectually
0	:
0	the
0	hills
0	being
0	under
0	the
0	line
0	in
0	a
0	more
0	heated
0	atmosphere
0	,
0	the
0	line
0	of
0	eternal
0	snow
0	,
0	is
0	there
0	naturally
0	more
0	removed
0	from
0	the
0	common
0	level
0	of
0	the
0	earth
0	,
0	than
0	towards
0	the
0	poles
0	,
0	where
0	the
0	air
0	is
0	neither
0	so
0	intensely
0	nor
0	so
0	constantly
0	heated
0	,
0	which
0	consequently
0	brings
0	the
0	line
0	of
0	eternal
0	snow
0	much
0	lower
0	.

0	They
0	were
0	hospitably
0	received
0	,
0	and
0	entertained
0	with
0	stewed
0	fish
0	,
0	venison-soups
0	,
0	and
0	other
0	dishes
0	,
0	dressed
0	after
0	the
0	manner
0	of
0	the
0	country
0	;

0	others
0	moved
0	off
0	from
0	her
0	with
0	a
0	velocity
0	almost
0	equal
0	to
0	lightning
0	.

0	Scarcely
0	had
0	night
0	spread
0	its
0	veil
0	over
0	the
0	surface
0	of
0	the
0	ocean
0	,
0	when
0	it
0	had
0	the
0	apperance
0	of
0	being
0	all
0	over
0	on
0	fire
0	.

0	But
0	before
0	these
0	could
0	return
0	,
0	there
0	came
0	from
0	the
0	town
0	boats
0	with
0	beef
0	,
0	veal
0	,
0	pork
0	,

0	,
0	turnips

0	every
0	other
0	article
0	of
0	provisions
0	which
0	the
0	island
0	produced
0	;

0	and
0	one
0	in
0	particular
0	,
0	with
PERSON-B	Capt.
PERSON-I	Cook
0	's
0	hanger
0	,
0	which
0	he
0	drew
0	in
0	a
0	vaunting
0	manner
0	,
0	and
0	brandished
0	it
0	over
0	his
0	head
0	;

0	The
0	latter
0	are
0	exactly
0	like
0	vaults
0	,
0	the
0	floors
0	of
0	which
0	are
0	sunk
0	a
0	little
0	below
0	the
0	surface
0	of
0	the
0	earth
0	,
0	and
0	boarded
0	,
0	and
0	under
0	them
0	a
0	kind
0	of
0	cellar
0	,
0	in
0	which
0	we
0	saw
0	nothing
0	but
0	water
0	.

0	About
0	2
0	in
0	the
0	afternoon
0	we
0	found
0	ourselves
0	surrounded
0	with
0	large
0	floating
0	islands
0	of
0	ice
0	,
0	which
0	,
0	like
0	clouds
0	in
0	the
0	sky
0	,
0	were
0	continually
0	varying
0	their
0	appearances
0	;

0	And
0	in
0	the
PLACE-B	Falkland
0	's
PLACE-B	Islands
0	,
0	the
0	thermometer
0	,
0	during
0	a
0	whole
0	year
0	,
0	did
0	not
0	vary
0	,
0	at
0	a
0	medium
0	,
0	above
0	20
0	°
0	.Q
0	It
0	is
0	therefore
0	evident
0	and
0	beyond
0	all
0	doubt
0	,
0	that
0	there
0	is
0	no
0	large
0	continent
0	from
0	60
0	°
0	to
0	71
0	°
0	and
0	upwards
0	and
0	that
0	the
0	inconsiderable
0	fragments
0	existing
0	there
0	,
0	are
0	much
0	colder
0	than
0	the
0	lands
0	in
0	any
0	corresponding
0	Northern
0	degree
0	.

0	under
0	it
0	we
0	found
0	an
0	argillaceous
0	substance
0	nearly
0	related
0	to
0	the
0	class
0	of
0	talcous
0	stones
0	,
0	which
0	is
0	turned
0	into
0	a
0	kind
0	of
0	earth
0	,
0	by
0	being
0	exposed
0	to
0	the
0	action
0	of
0	the
0	sun
0	,
0	air
0	,
0	rain
0	and
0	frost
0	,
0	and
0	is
0	of
0	various
0	thickness
0	:
0	still
0	deeper
0	the
0	same
0	is
0	indurated
0	into
0	stone
0	,
0	running
0	in
0	oblique
0	strata
0	dipping
0	generally
0	to
0	the
0	South
0	:
0	their
0	hardness
0	varies
0	considerably
0	,
0	for
0	some
0	of
0	the
0	most
0	indurated
0	and
0	compact
0	will
0	strike
0	fire
0	with
0	steel
0	.

0	and
0	as
0	they
0	varied
0	their
0	position
0	with
0	respect
0	to
0	the
0	light
0	,
0	they
0	emitted
0	the
0	brightest
0	colours
0	of
0	the
0	most
0	precious
0	gems
0	.

0	Such
0	is
0	the
0	variableness
0	of
0	the
0	weather
0	near
0	the
0	tropics
0	.

0	but
0	by
0	their
0	manner
0	of
0	using
0	what
0	they
0	possessed
0	,
0	it
0	was
0	not
0	easy
0	to
0	discover
0	from
0	what
0	quarter
0	it
0	came
0	.

0	The

0	parts
0	of
0	all
0	the
0	rivulets
0	in

0	,
0	are
0	not
0	so
0	useless
0	or
0	neglected
0	,
0	as
0	might
0	be
0	imagined
0	.

0	Under

0	,
0	on

0	,
0	and

0	delivering

0	of

0	not

0	Besides

0	of

0	who

PERSON-B	the

0	there

0	who
0	had

0	.

0	In
0	the

0	in
0	justice
0	to
0	this
0	worthy
0	Governor
0	,
0	were
0	we
0	to
0	pass
0	over
0	his
0	behaviour
0	to
0	us
0	unnoticed
0	;

0	These
0	precautions
0	,
0	however
0	,
0	seemed
0	unnecessary
0	,
0	as
0	they
0	never
0	met
0	with
0	any
0	molestation
0	from
0	the
0	natives
0	,
0	who
0	were
0	not
0	numerous
0	upon
0	the
0	coast
0	.

0	On
0	the
0	1st
0	of
0	July
0	the
0	signal
0	was
0	given
0	to
0	unmoor
0	;

0	—
0	Like
0	unlucky
0	boys
0	,
0	when
0	one
0	is
0	apprehended
0	for
0	some
0	naughty
0	trick
0	,
0	the
0	rest
0	commonly
0	fly
0	the
0	place
0	.

0	and
0	when
0	the
0	boats
0	were
0	unloaded
0	,
0	returned
0	for
0	more
0	.

0	On
0	the
0	26th
0	,
0	the
0	wind
0	abated
0	and
0	came
0	fair
0	to
0	carry
0	us
0	to
0	sea
0	,
0	and
0	the
0	ship
0	being
0	found
0	unhurt
0	,
0	we
0	weighed
0	,
0	and
0	,
0	having
0	cleared
0	the
0	harbour
0	,
0	made
0	sail
0	,
0	directing
0	our
0	course
0	up
0	the
0	race
0	,
0	to
0	the
0	N.
0	W.
0	At
0	eight
0	o
0	'clock
0	we
0	were
0	out
0	of
0	the
0	race
0	,
0	but
0	still
0	continued
0	our
0	course
0	to
0	the
0	Westward
0	,
0	when
0	at
0	midnight
0	a
0	heavy
0	gale
0	came
0	on
0	attended
0	with
0	snow
0	and
0	rain
0	.

0	The
0	first
0	thing
0	,
0	therefore
0	,
0	to
0	be
0	done
0	,
0	was
0	to
0	unhinge
0	it
0	and
0	get
0	it
0	on
0	shore
0	;

0	In
0	the
0	first
0	onset
PERSON-B	Capt.
PERSON-I	Cook
0	and
0	four
0	of
0	his
0	people
0	were
0	unhappily
0	killed
0	upon
0	the
0	spot
0	;

0	but
0	we
0	found
0	the
0	contrary
0	to
0	be
0	true
0	:
0	for
0	close
0	to
0	the
0	reef
0	forming
0	these
0	isles
0	,
0	the
0	water
0	is
0	almost
0	unfathomable
0	.

0	that
0	on
0	enquiring
0	into
0	this
0	unexpected
0	alteration
0	in
0	their
0	sentiments
0	,
0	they
0	had
0	informed
0	his
0	people
0	,
0	that
0	towards
0	the
0	letter
0	end
0	of
0	the
0	last
0	summer
0	they
0	had
0	been
0	visited
0	by
0	two
0	very
0	large
0	Ruffian
0	boats
0	,
0	that
0	they
0	had
0	been
0	treated
0	by
0	the
0	people
0	who
0	were
0	in
0	them
0	with
0	the
0	greatest
0	kindness
0	,
0	and
0	had
0	entered
0	into
0	a
0	league
0	of
0	friendship
0	and
0	amity
0	with
0	them
0	;

0	for
0	this
0	may
0	be
0	done
0	with
0	as
0	much
0	ease
0	and
0	propriety
0	to
0	the
0	large
0	ice-mountains
0	,
0	which
0	remain
0	undissolved
0	floating
0	in
0	the
0	ocean
0	in
0	high
0	latitudes
0	:
0	or
0	it
0	may
0	,
0	perhaps
0	,
0	not
0	be
0	improper
0	to
0	suppose
0	,
0	that
0	the
0	whole
0	Polar
0	region
0	,
0	from
0	80
0	°
0	and
0	upwards
0	,
0	in
0	the
0	Southern
0	hemisphere
0	,
0	remains
0	a
0	solid
0	ice
0	for
0	several
0	years
0	together
0	,
0	to
0	which
0	yearly
0	a
0	new
0	circle
0	of
0	ice
0	is
0	added
0	,
0	and
0	of
0	which
0	,
0	however
0	,
0	part
0	is
0	broken
0	off
0	by
0	the
0	winds
0	,
0	and
0	the
0	return
0	of
0	the
0	mild
0	season
0	.

0	It
0	seems
0	to
0	be
0	undeniable
0	,
0	that
0	the
0	ice
0	we
0	met
0	with
0	in
0	the
0	open
0	ocean
0	,
0	in
0	50
0	°
0	and
0	67
0	°
0	,
0	or
0	even
0	71
0	°
0	South
0	latitude
0	,
0	is
0	formed
0	still
0	farther
0	to
0	the
0	South
0	.

0	In
0	a
0	moment
0	,
0	every
0	Indian
0	in
0	the
0	cove
0	disappeared
0	,
0	and
0	in
0	less
0	than
0	three
0	hours
0	more
0	than
0	900
0	of
0	them
0	assembled
0	in
0	the
PLACE-B	Sound
0	,
0	and
0	being
0	unclothed
0	,
0	(
0	which
0	is
0	their
0	custom
0	when
0	they
0	mean
0	to
0	engage
0	)
0	began
0	their
0	war-song
0	,
0	and
0	approached
0	the
0	ships
0	.

0	but
0	had
0	he
0	been
0	inclined
0	to
0	give
0	ear
0	to
0	this
0	uncandid
0	insinuation
0	,
0	or
0	to
0	the
0	natural
0	jealousy
0	and
0	distrust
0	of
0	the
0	Kamtschatskadales
0	,
0	(
0	for
0	they
0	had
0	not
0	yet
0	got
0	rid
0	of
0	the
0	panic
0	with
0	which
0	they
0	were
0	seized
0	at
0	our
0	first
0	approach
0	,
0	)
0	an
0	incident
0	had
0	just
0	happened
0	,
0	that
0	would
0	have
0	infallibly
0	established
0	their
0	credit
0	.

0	The
PERSON-B	King
0	being
0	told
0	that
0	his
0	request
0	was
0	granted
0	,
0	unbound
0	him
0	,
0	and
0	set
0	him
0	at
0	liberty
0	;

0	In
0	this
0	horrid
0	situation
0	we
0	handed
0	all
0	our
0	sails
0	,
0	unbent
0	our
0	fore-top-sail
0	,
0	and
0	moored
0	ship
0	with
0	both
0	our
0	ice
0	anchors
0	,
0	one
0	to
0	each
0	bow
0	.

0	sometimes
0	the
0	sea
0	assumes
0	a
0	grey
0	hue
0	,
0	and
0	seems
0	turbid
0	,
0	as
0	if
0	it
0	had
0	lost
0	its
0	limpidity
0	.

0	The
0	rudder
0	's
0	eyes
0	were
0	almost
0	eaten
0	through
0	with
0	rust
0	,
0	and
0	the
0	bolts
0	ready
0	to
0	tumble
0	out
0	.

0	ttas
0	,
0	and
0	the
0	latter
0	Pahà-b-shan
0	.

0	On
0	the
0	29th
0	we
0	made
0	sail
0	with
0	a
0	fresh
0	wind
0	,
0	and
0	advanced
0	apace
0	,
0	but
0	on
0	trying
0	the
0	water
0	we
0	found
0	a
0	great
0	alteration
0	from
0	salt
0	to
0	fresh
0	.

0	insulting
0	us
0	,
0	as
0	it
0	were
0	,
0	with
0	the
0	trophies
0	of
0	their
0	victory
0	.

0	Here
0	and
0	there
0	I
0	observed
0	a
0	substance
0	commonly
0	called
0	rotten-stone
0	,
0	which
0	is
0	a
0	brown
0	clayey
0	tripoli
0	;

0	This
0	day
0	several
0	natives
0	came
0	from
0	the
0	S.
0	S.
0	E.
0	side
0	,
0	in
0	large
0	canoes
0	,
0	having
0	great
0	quantities
0	of
0	salmon
0	,
0	dried
0	and
0	fresh
0	,
0	which
0	they
0	exchanged
0	for
0	blue
0	and
0	red
0	beads
0	,
0	needles
0	,
0	pins
0	,
0	knives
0	,
0	or
0	scissars
0	,
0	or
0	any
0	European
0	trinkets
0	that
0	were
0	offered
0	them
0	;

0	One
0	peculiarity
0	we
0	observed
0	among
0	the
0	men
0	,
0	and
0	that
0	was
0	,
0	in
0	the
0	cut
0	of
0	their
0	hair
0	,
0	which
0	they
0	trimmed
0	up
0	to
0	a
0	ridge
0	along
0	their
0	heads
0	,
0	in
0	form
0	like
0	what
0	,
0	in
0	horses
0	manes
0	,
0	is
0	called
0	hogging
0	.

0	and
0	that
0	relying
0	on
0	this
0	friendly
0	disposition
0	,
0	they
0	are
0	now
0	come
0	to
0	the
0	Ruffian
0	fort
0	,
0	in
0	order
0	to
0	settle
0	a
0	treaty
0	on
0	such
0	terms
0	as
0	might
0	be
0	acceptable
0	to
0	both
0	nations
0	.

0	and
0	it
0	was
0	with
0	the
0	kindest
0	treatment
0	from
0	their
0	officers
0	,
0	that
0	the
0	men
0	could
0	be
0	kept
0	to
0	their
0	duty
0	;

0	for
0	after
0	travelling
0	two
0	days
0	and
0	two
0	nights
0	,
0	and
0	experiencing
0	the
0	greatest
0	fatigue
0	and
0	hardships
0	;

0	they
0	consist
0	of
0	flat
0	pieces
0	of
0	wood
0	,
0	joined
0	at
0	both
0	ends
0	,
0	and
0	kept
0	apart
0	in
0	the
0	middle
0	by
0	a
0	transverse
0	piece
0	,
0	through
0	which
0	there
0	is
0	a
0	round
0	hole
0	,
0	just
0	large
0	enough
0	for
0	the
0	man
0	to
0	insert
0	his
0	legs
0	,
0	and
0	to
0	seat
0	himself
0	on
0	a
0	bench
0	made
0	on
0	purpose
0	;

0	But
0	what
0	was
0	most
0	remarkable
0	,
0	was
0	the
0	sudden
0	transition
0	from
0	heat
0	to
0	such
0	severe
0	cold
0	.

0	Whenever
0	we
0	approached
0	large
0	tracts
0	of
0	solid
0	ice
0	,
0	we
0	observed
0	,
0	on
0	the
0	horizon
0	,
0	a
0	white
0	reflexion
0	from
0	the
0	snow
0	and
0	ice
0	,
0	which
0	the
0	Greenlandmen
0	call
0	the
0	blink
0	of
0	the
0	ice
0	:
0	so
0	that
0	seeing
0	this
0	phaenomenon
0	appear
0	,
0	we
0	were
0	sure
0	to
0	be
0	within
0	a
0	few
0	leagues
0	of
0	the
0	ice
0	;

0	The
0	4th
0	at
0	noon
0	,
0	sounding
0	from
0	fifteen
0	toten
0	fathom
0	we
0	came
0	again
0	in
0	sight
0	of
0	land
0	,
0	which
0	bore
0	from
0	us
0	W.
0	to
0	N.
0	½
0	E.
0	At
0	noon
0	we
0	sounded
0	,
0	and
0	found
0	only
0	eight
0	fathoms
0	and
0	a
0	half
0	.

0	but
0	they
0	had
0	a
0	slit
0	between
0	their
0	lower
0	lip
0	and
0	chin
0	,
0	through
0	which
0	they
0	could
0	put
0	their
0	tongue
0	,
0	that
0	gave
0	them
0	the
0	appearance
0	of
0	having
0	a
0	double
0	mouth
0	.

0	Nothing
0	could
0	be
0	more
0	toilsome
0	or
0	distressing
0	than
0	our
0	present
0	situation
0	;

0	but
0	they
0	have
0	neither
0	frog
0	,
0	toad
0	,
0	nor
0	serpent
0	.

0	If
0	they
0	kill
0	or
0	maim
0	,
0	so
0	that
0	the
0	bear
0	cannot
0	pursue
0	,
0	'
0	tis
0	well
0	;

0	because
0	the
0	largest
0	masses
0	are
0	commonly
0	transparent
0	like
0	crystal
0	,
0	with
0	a
0	fine
0	blue
0	tinct
0	,
0	caused
0	by
0	the
0	reflection
0	of
0	the
0	sea
0	.

0	On
0	the
0	morning
0	of
0	the
0	27th
0	,
0	the
0	wind
0	abated
0	but
0	the
0	swell
0	still
0	continued
0	from
0	the
0	Southward
0	and
0	we
0	proceeded
0	under
0	close
0	reefed
0	top-sails
0	til
0	about
0	ten
0	in
0	the
0	morning
0	,
0	when
0	we
0	shook
0	out
0	the
0	reefs
0	,
0	and
0	made
0	all
0	the
0	sail
0	we
0	could
0	,
0	in
0	company
0	with
0	the
0	Resolution
0	.

0	and
0	then
0	thrust
0	his
0	pahooa
0	through
0	his
0	body
0	with
0	such
0	force
0	,
0	that
0	,
0	entering
0	between
0	his
0	shoulders
0	,
0	the
0	point
0	of
0	it
0	came
0	out
0	at
0	his
0	breast
0	.

0	They
0	throw
0	away
0	all
0	the
0	clothes
0	of
0	the
0	deceased
0	,
0	because
0	they
0	believe
0	that
0	they
0	who
0	wear
0	them
0	will
0	die
0	before
0	their
0	time
0	.

0	extending
0	through
0	an
0	immense
0	space
0	,
0	or
0	three-fourths
0	of
0	the
0	whole
0	South-Sea
0	.

0	As
0	night
0	approached
0	the
0	clouds
0	began
0	to
0	lour
0	,
0	and
0	to
0	threaten
0	another
0	storm
0	:
0	but
0	except
0	some
0	snow
0	and
0	hail
0	which
0	fell
0	in
0	the
0	night
0	,
0	nothing
0	remarkable
0	happened
0	till
0	The
0	25th
0	,
0	when
0	a
0	thick
0	fog
0	arose
0	,
0	and
0	we
0	lost
0	sight
0	of
0	the
0	Resolution
0	;

0	The
0	19th
0	when
0	looking
0	round
0	in
0	the
0	morning
0	,
0	as
0	soon
0	as
0	the
0	fog
0	cleared
0	away
0	,
0	we
0	saw
0	nothing
0	but
0	fields
0	of
0	ice
0	covered
0	with
0	whole
0	herds
0	of
0	sea-lions
0	,
0	/
0	&gt;
0	sea-horses
0	,
0	and
0	other
0	amphibious
0	animals
0	,
0	to
0	the
0	number
0	,
0	as
0	it
0	was
0	thought
0	,
0	of
0	some
0	thousands
0	.

0	This
0	being
0	observed
0	,
0	all
0	on
0	board
0	were
0	struck
0	with
0	fear
0	for
0	the
0	safety
0	of
0	the
0	Discovery
0	,
0	thinking
0	that
0	some
0	fatal
0	disaster
0	had
0	happened
0	,
0	and
0	that
0	she
0	was
0	going
0	to
0	the
0	bottom
0	.

0	Under
0	these
0	they
0	had
0	a
0	kind
0	of
0	trowsers
0	,
0	which
0	parted
0	in
0	the
0	middle
0	,
0	and
0	surrounded
0	their
0	thighs
0	.

0	nor
0	did
0	they
0	seem
0	quite
0	so
0	thievishly
0	inclined
0	as
0	those
0	on
0	the
0	other
0	side
0	the
0	line
0	.

0	They
0	discovered
0	no
0	propensity
0	to
0	thieve
0	,
0	till
0	they
0	found
0	we
0	were
0	preparing
0	to
0	depart
0	,
0	and
0	then
0	they
0	were
0	so
0	covetous
0	of
0	our
0	goods
0	,
0	that
0	they
0	could
0	not
0	resist
0	the
0	temptation
0	,
0	when
0	a
0	fair
0	opportunity
0	offered
0	,
0	to
0	carry
0	off
0	whatever
0	fell
0	in
0	their
0	way
0	.

0	I
0	pretend
0	not
0	to
0	defend
0	any
0	particular
0	hypothesis
0	relative
0	to
0	the
0	theory
0	of
0	the
0	earth
0	;

0	These
0	they
0	held
0	in
0	constant
0	readiness
0	,
0	never
0	quitting
0	them
0	,
0	except
0	at
0	one
0	time
0	,
0	when
0	four
0	or
0	five
0	of
0	them
0	laid
0	theirs
0	down
0	,
0	while
0	they
0	gave
0	us
0	a
0	song
0	and
0	a
0	dance
0	.

0	The
0	high
0	climates
0	near
0	the
0	Poles
0	,
0	are
0	likewise
0	subject
0	to
0	heavy
0	falls
0	of
0	snow
0	,
0	of
0	several
0	yards
0	in
0	thickness
0	,
0	which
0	grow
0	more
0	and
0	more
0	compact
0	,
0	and
0	by
0	thaws
0	and
0	rain
0	,
0	are
0	formed
0	into
0	solid
0	ice
0	,
0	which
0	increase
0	the
0	stupendous
0	size
0	of
0	the
0	floating
0	ice-mountains
0	.

0	As
0	tobacco
0	was
0	a
0	precious
0	commodity
0	on
0	board
0	,
0	we
0	could
0	spare
0	them
0	little
0	,
0	but
0	for
0	that
0	little
0	they
0	were
0	thankful
0	,
0	and
0	departed
0	.

0	We
0	were
0	now
0	close
0	under
0	them
0	,
0	and
0	the
0	roaring
0	they
0	made
0	was
0	infinitely
0	more
0	terrifying
0	than
0	the
0	most
0	tremendous
0	thunder
0	.

0	They
0	are
0	built
0	tent-fashion
0	,
0	and
0	are
0	covered
0	from
0	top
0	to
0	bottom
0	.

0	I
0	wanted
0	to
0	examine
0	one
0	in
0	the
0	water
0	,
0	and
0	then
0	bring
0	it
0	under
0	the
0	microscope
0	,
0	but
0	I
0	could
0	not
0	provide
0	a
0	live
0	animalcule
0	:
0	they
0	were
0	all
0	dead
0	,
0	on
0	account
0	of
0	their
0	tender
0	structure
0	,
0	before
0	I
0	could
0	separate
0	them
0	from
0	the
0	finger
0	to
0	which
0	they
0	were
0	flicking
0	.

0	At
0	five
0	in
0	the
0	evening
0	,
0	we
0	were
0	two
0	leagues
0	from
0	the
0	shore
0	,
0	surrounded
0	by
0	Indians
0	in
0	their
0	canoes
0	,
0	with
0	hogs
0	in
0	abundance
0	,
0	some
0	very
0	large
0	,
0	which
0	we
0	purchased
0	according
0	to
0	their
0	size
0	,
0	for
0	a
0	spike
0	or
0	a
0	ten-penny
0	nail
0	each
0	.

0	The
0	whole
0	party
0	now
0	assembled
0	,
0	and
0	orders
0	were
0	given
0	by
0	the
0	commanding
0	officers
0	to
0	erect
0	temporary
0	huts
0	to
0	shelter
0	them
0	from
0	the
0	evening
0	damps
0	.

0	The
0	temper
0	of
0	the
0	Indians
0	was
0	now
0	totally
0	changed
0	,
0	and
0	they
0	became
0	every
0	day
0	more
0	and
0	more
0	troublesome
0	.

0	telling
0	the
0	Captain
0	that
0	,
0	seeing
0	him
0	with
0	the
0	silk
0	,
0	he
0	judged
0	it
0	was
0	none
0	of
0	his
0	own
0	,
0	and
0	therefore
0	ordered
0	him
0	to
0	be
0	apprehended
0	;

0	but
0	with
0	these
0	tools
0	their
0	work
0	was
0	tedious
0	and
0	difficult
0	.

0	To
0	iron
0	they
0	gave
0	the
0	name
0	of
0	te-tum-miné
0	,
0	and
0	to
0	other
0	metals
0	ché-à-poté
0	.

0	The
0	men
0	in
0	these
0	islands
0	are
0	of
0	the
0	middle
0	size
0	,
0	of
0	a
0	dark
0	complexion
0	,
0	not
0	much
0	tattowed
0	,
0	but
0	of
0	a
0	lively
0	open
0	countenance
0	.

0	nor
0	have
0	they
0	any
0	tail
0	.

0	quos
0	tactus
0	!

0	Being
0	apprehensive
0	of
0	danger
0	,
0	the
0	signal
0	was
0	made
0	for
0	tacking
0	.

0	and
0	that
0	the
0	ground
0	they
0	had
0	occasion
0	for
0	should
0	be
0	marked
0	out
0	and
0	taboo
0	'd
0	,
0	that
0	is
0	,
0	appropriated
0	to
0	their
0	use
0	,
0	without
0	any
0	of
0	the
0	natives
0	being
0	permitted
0	to
0	encroach
0	upon
0	it
0	.

0	All
0	this
0	while
0	our
0	botanist
0	and
0	his
0	attendants
0	were
0	busily
0	employed
0	,
0	and
0	sent
0	plenty
0	of
0	celery
0	and
0	other
0	wholesome
0	herbs
0	on
0	board
0	,
0	as
0	well
0	for
0	the
0	use
0	of
0	the
0	great
0	cabin
0	as
0	for
0	those
0	of
0	the
0	subordinate
0	tables
0	,
0	down
0	even
0	to
0	the
0	lowest
0	of
0	the
0	ship
0	's
0	company
0	.

0	Some
0	of
0	our
0	gentlemen
0	who
0	went
0	to
0	return
0	the
0	visit
0	,
0	were
0	met
0	by
0	an
0	officer
0	,
0	who
0	received
0	them
0	politely
0	,
0	and
0	directed
0	them
0	to
0	the
0	factory
0	,
0	where
0	,
0	besides
0	the
0	fort
0	,
0	they
0	found
0	a
0	Russian
0	bark
0	of
0	about
0	50
0	or
0	60
0	tons
0	,
0	eight
0	small
0	swivels
0	,
0	and
0	one
0	three
0	pounder
0	laid
0	up
0	for
0	the
0	winter
0	,
0	and
0	intended
0	for
0	Kamsha
0	•
0	ska
0	the
0	ensuing
0	summer
0	.

0	at
0	the
0	same
0	time
0	,
0	we
0	observed
0	a
0	large
0	whale
0	to
0	pass
0	along
0	,
0	at
0	which
0	we
0	fired
0	a
0	swivel
0	,
0	but
0	without
0	effect
0	.

0	Here
0	we
0	put
0	ashore
0	the
0	family
0	that
0	accompanied
0	us
0	from
0	O-why-e
0	,
0	and
0	here
0	we
0	purchased
0	a
0	few
0	small
0	swine
0	;

0	Both
0	ships
0	stood
0	again
0	W.
0	S.
0	W.
0	all
0	night
0	with
0	little
0	wind
0	,
0	but
0	great
0	swells
0	from
0	the
0	Eastward
0	,
0	lat
0	.

0	After
0	sustaining
0	an
0	unequal
0	conflict
0	for
0	three
0	hours
0	,
0	in
0	which
0	several
0	of
0	them
0	were
0	killed
0	,
0	without
0	being
0	able
0	to
0	make
0	any
0	impression
0	on
0	our
0	small
0	body
0	,
0	and
0	without
0	our
0	losing
0	a
0	man
0	,
0	though
0	several
0	were
0	much
0	hurt
0	by
0	the
0	stones
0	from
0	their
0	slings
0	,
0	they
0	at
0	length
0	dispersed
0	,
0	and
0	left
0	us
0	masters
0	of
0	our
0	tents
0	and
0	of
0	all
0	our
0	other
0	property
0	.

0	In
0	this
0	situation
0	they
0	lay
0	till
0	the
0	next
0	evening
0	,
0	when
0	they
0	were
0	again
0	well
0	wiped
0	and
0	examined
0	,
0	and
0	the
0	suspicious
0	parts
0	taken
0	away
0	.

0	and
0	he
0	surrendered
0	it
0	,
0	but
0	with
0	such
0	a
0	fierceness
0	expressed
0	in
0	his
0	countenance
0	,
0	as
0	sufficiently
0	indicated
0	his
0	intent
0	.

0	What
0	seems
0	surprising
0	is
0	,
0	that
0	the
0	men
0	on
0	the
0	island
0	dare
0	hardly
0	go
0	near
0	them
0	when
0	loose
0	in
0	the
0	woods
0	;

0	The
0	real
0	grandeur
0	of
0	the
0	sight
0	by
0	far
0	surpassed
0	any
0	thing
0	I
0	could
0	expect
0	;

0	We
0	had
0	with
0	difficulty
0	weighed
0	our
0	small
0	bower
0	,
0	and
0	had
0	made
0	two
0	unsuccessful
0	attempts
0	at
0	the
0	sheet
0	anchor
0	,
0	when
0	the
0	Resolution
0	left
0	us
0	,
0	making
0	all
0	the
0	sail
0	she
0	could
0	carry
0	,
0	to
0	surmount
0	the
0	current
0	.

0	and
0	however
0	they
0	might
0	be
0	surfeited
0	with
0	what
0	they
0	had
0	seen
0	,
0	they
0	shewed
0	by
0	the
0	dinner
0	they
0	made
0	that
0	they
0	had
0	not
0	lost
0	their
0	appetite
0	.

PERSON-B	Capt.
PERSON-I	Clerke
0	made
0	him
0	some
0	suitable
0	presents
0	,
0	and
0	received
0	from
0	him
0	in
0	return
0	,
0	a
0	large
0	bowl
0	,
0	supported
0	by
0	two
0	figures
0	of
0	men
0	,
0	the
0	carving
0	of
0	which
0	,
0	both
0	as
0	to
0	design
0	and
0	execution
0	,
0	shewed
0	some
0	degree
0	of
0	skill
0	.

0	They
0	are
0	very
0	superstitious
0	:
0	and
0	the
0	women
0	in
0	particular
0	pretend
0	to
0	avert
0	misfortunes
0	,
0	cure
0	diseases
0	,
0	and
0	foretel
0	future
0	events
0	,
0	by
0	muttering
0	incantations
0	over
0	the
0	fins
0	of
0	fishes
0	,
0	mingled
0	with
0	a
0	certain
0	herb
0	,
0	which
0	they
0	gather
0	from
0	the
0	woods
0	with
0	much
0	labour
0	.

0	Our
0	Captain
0	took
0	notice
0	of
0	two
0	that
0	seemed
0	superior
0	to
0	the
0	rest
0	,
0	he
0	invited
0	them
0	on
0	board
0	,
0	and
0	with
0	much
0	entreaty
0	prevailed
0	on
0	them
0	to
0	enter
0	.

0	As
0	they
0	went
0	along
0	,
0	the
0	Priests
0	,
0	in
0	the
0	centre
0	canoe
0	,
0	sung
0	their
0	hymns
0	with
0	great
0	solemnity
0	;

0	On
0	the
0	1st
0	of
0	August
0	,
0	just
0	at
0	sun-set
0	,
0	we
0	saw
0	a
0	sail
0	at
0	a
0	great
0	distance
0	to
0	the
0	Westward
0	,
0	but
0	in
0	the
0	morning
0	she
0	was
0	quite
0	out
0	of
0	sight
0	.

0	Our
0	gentlemen
0	's
0	entertainment
0	there
0	was
0	rather
0	friendly
0	than
0	sumptuous
0	;

0	and
0	a
0	man
0	,
0	by
0	great
0	and
0	indefatigable
0	labour
0	,
0	continued
0	during
0	two
0	summer-seasons
0	,
0	succeeded
0	so
0	far
0	in
0	this
0	laborious
0	task
0	,
0	that
0	he
0	at
0	last
0	reached
0	the
0	depth
0	of
0	91
0	feet
0	;

0	The
0	summer-huts
0	were
0	pretty
0	large
0	and
0	conical
0	.

0	and
0	before
0	we
0	left
0	our
0	station
0	,
0	there
0	came
0	in
0	another
0	worth
0	double
0	that
0	sum
0	.

0	From
0	a
0	sullenness
0	and
0	discontent
0	visible
0	in
0	every
0	countenance
0	the
0	day
0	before
0	,
0	all
0	was
0	chearfulness
0	,
0	mirth
0	and
0	jollity
0	.

0	At
0	nine
0	in
0	the
0	morning
0	of
0	the
0	next
0	day
0	,
0	the
0	same
0	old
0	Chief
0	returned
0	,
0	attended
0	by
0	a
0	more
0	numerous
0	suit
0	than
0	before
0	,
0	having
0	several
0	large
0	hogs
0	added
0	to
0	his
0	peace-offerings
0	;

0	and
0	another
0	bag
0	containing
0	20
0	pounds
0	of
0	tea
0	,
0	and
0	20
0	loaves
0	of
0	sugar
0	,
0	as
0	the
0	present
0	from
0	the
0	Governor
0	's
0	lady
0	to
0	the
0	officers
0	;

0	It
0	was
0	therefore
0	no
0	small

0	It

0	Early

0	the

0	,
0	and
0	both

0	proceeded

0	the

0	which
0	for
0	the

0	twenty
0	days
0	they

0	During

0	every
0	thing
0	remained
0	quiet
0	at
0	the

0	,
0	and
0	the

0	Accordingly
0	they
0	set
0	out
0	,
0	and
0	before

0	In

0	far

0	and
0	here
0	we

0	the

0	of
PLACE-B	Easter

0	therefore
0	they

0	be
0	of

0	Some

0	At
PLACE-B	O-Aite-peha
0	the

0	About
0	two
0	in
0	the
0	morning
0	of
0	the

0	we
0	observed
0	a
0	great
0	body
0	of

0	nearing
0	us
0	very
0	fast
0	,
0	and
0	in

0	we
0	saw
0	the

0	all
0	closed
0	as
0	far
0	/

0	as

0	On
0	the

0	several
0	pieces

0	us
0	,
0	one

0	sought
0	in
0	the

0	He
0	came
0	to
0	express
0	his
0	sorrow
0	for
0	the
0	accident
0	that
0	had
0	happened
0	,
0	which

0	it

0	nothing

0	parts

0	and

0	,
0	a

0	between

0	our

0	with

0	by

0	The

0	across

0	when

0	their

0	Our

0	make
0	out
0	,
0	that
0	a
0	Russian
0	Captain
0	had
0	been
0	murdered
0	by
0	the

0	,
0	and
0	that
0	the
0	Russians
0	had
0	taken
0	a

0	,
0	and
0	had
0	laid

0	,
0	and
PERSON-B	Capt.
PERSON-I	Clerke
0	remonstrated

0	so

0	he

PERSON-B	Capt.
PERSON-I	Cook

0	The

0	,
0	being
PERSON-B	his
PERSON-I	Majesty
0	's
0	birth-day
0	we
0	kept
0	as
0	a
0	day
0	of
0	rejoicing
0	.

0	They
0	brought
0	,
0	after
0	a

0	,
0	a

0	with

0	we

0	little

0	On
0	the

0	we
0	passed
0	Tschutuskoi-noss
0	,
0	called
0	by
0	the
0	sailors
0	Tuskan-noss
0	,
0	and
0	soon
0	came
0	in
0	sight
0	of
PERSON-B	Cook
0	's
0	town
0	,
0	which
0	we
0	visited
0	the

0	,
0	as
0	has
0	already
0	been
0	mentioned
0	,
0	and
0	which
0	we
0	now
0	passed
0	with
0	regret
0	.

0	We
0	now
0	began
0	to
0	reflect
0	on
0	our
0	condition
0	;

0	quam
0	bona
0	fide

0	There

0	,
0	for
0	recovering

0	He
0	again
0	had
0	recourse
0	to
0	his
0	first
0	expedient
0	,
0	and
0	mounted
0	a
0	tree
0	that
0	over-topped
0	the

0	,
0	and
0	got
0	sight
0	of

0	high

0	that
0	first
0	animated
0	his
0	pursuit
0	.

0	To

0	therefore
0	,

0	,

0	every

0	and
0	the

0	for

0	round
0	reconnoitred

0	(

0	down
0	with
0	hard

0	,
0	though
0	none
0	were

0	We
0	were
0	very
0	soon
0	surrounded
0	with
0	our
0	old
0	friends
0	,
0	who
0	brought

0	hogs

0	bread-fruit
0	,

0	The

0	people

0	We
0	saw

0	near
0	the

0	,
0	by
0	which
0	it

0	being
0	in

0	and
0	gave
0	orders
0	to
0	prepare
0	for
0	sailing
0	.

0	They
0	had
0	dried

0	too
0	,
0	probably
0	the

PERSON-B	the

0	so

0	It

0	The

0	which
0	are

0	,
0	wherein

0	collect
0	the

0	:

0	a

0	slung
0	over

0	with

0	We

0	that
0	an

0	round
0	luminous
0	bodies
0	were
0	moving
0	in

0	with
0	amazing

0	Orders
0	were
0	given
0	,
0	as
0	soon
0	as
0	the

0	,
0	to
0	quicken
0	the

0	with
0	the

0	as
0	fast
0	as
0	possible
0	.

0	and
0	when
0	he
0	departed
0	,
0	requested
0	that
0	they
0	might
0	be
0	permitted
0	to
0	make
0	him
0	a
0	Pahoo-a

0	We

0	This

0	Though

0	however
0	nearly

0	we
0	reckon

0	the

0	and
0	that
0	is
0	,
0	pulling
0	out
0	one

0	We

0	instantly

0	and
0	stood
0	to
0	the
0	North
0	,
0	having
0	had
0	another
0	providential
0	escape
0	from
0	running
0	upon
0	the
0	rocks
0	.

0	and
PERSON-B	Mr.
PERSON-I	King
0	,
0	second
0	Lieutenant
0	of
0	the
0	Resolution
0	,
0	who
0	had
0	always
0	been
0	stationed
0	with
0	a
0	guard
0	to
0	protect
0	the
0	working
0	party
0	and
0	the
0	waterers
0	on

0	,
0	went
0	,
0	as
0	usual
0	,
0	to
0	the
0	other
0	side
0	.

0	Their
0	winter
0	habitation
0	is
0	made
0	by
0	digging
0	a
0	square
0	hole
0	in
0	the
0	earth
0	,
0	about
0	five
0	or
0	six
0	feet
0	deep
0	,
0	the
0	length
0	and
0	breadth
0	being
0	proportioned
0	to
0	the
0	number
0	of
0	people
0	that
0	are
0	to
0	live
0	in
0	it
0	.

0	but
0	are
0	separated
0	by
0	a
0	strait
0	between
0	two
0	promontories
0	,
0	which
0	in
0	clear
0	weather
0	are
0	so
0	near
0	as
0	to
0	be
0	seen
0	in
0	sailing
0	through
0	with
0	the
0	naked
0	eye
0	.

0	In
0	this
0	long
0	run
0	,
0	we
0	passed
0	several
0	remarkable
0	promontaries
0	and
0	islands
0	,
0	particularly
0	in
0	lat
0	.

0	We
0	found
0	ourselves
0	,
0	after
0	a
0	few
0	minutes
0	stay
0	,
0	in
0	a
0	profuse
0	perspiration
0	,
0	occasioned
0	by
0	the
0	hot
0	steams
0	,
0	and
0	the
0	heat
0	of
0	the
0	ground
0	we
0	stood
0	on
0	,
0	which
0	in
0	some
0	places
0	was
0	intolerable
0	.

0	More
0	than
0	200
0	canoes
0	attended
0	us
0	to
0	shore
0	,
0	where
0	a
0	number
0	of
0	Chiefs
0	were
0	ready
0	to
0	receive
0	us
0	,
0	who
0	ail
0	observed
0	a
0	profound
0	silence
0	at
0	our
0	landing
0	,
0	and
0	conducted
0	us
0	to
0	the
0	place
0	appointed
0	for
0	the
0	entertainment
0	.

0	but
0	their
0	manner
0	of
0	hunting
0	them
0	,
0	is
0	attended
0	with
0	much
0	danger
0	and
0	little

0	.

0	—
0	We
0	had
0	no
0	sooner
0	dropt
0	anchor
0	than
0	our
0	boat
0	was
0	ordered
0	out
0	,
0	and
0	our
0	Captain
0	,
0	with
0	several
0	other
0	gentlemen
0	,
0	went
0	to
0	visit
PERSON-B	Capt.
PERSON-I	Clerke
0	,
0	and
0	to
0	take
0	his
0	orders
0	for
0	our
0	future
0	proceedings
0	.

0	and
0	by
0	the
0	Apollo
0	frigate
0	and
0	her
0	consort
0	:
0	they
0	brought
0	in
0	a
0	prize
0	,
0	valued
0	at
0	10,000l.
0	and
0	both
0	Captains
0	came
0	to
0	visit
PERSON-B	Capt.
PERSON-I	Gore
0	,
0	on
0	board
0	the
0	Resolution
0	,
0	who
0	now
0	was
0	taken
0	very
0	ill
0	,
0	and
0	so
0	continued
0	to
0	the
0	end
0	of
0	the
0	voyage
0	.

0	Some
0	privicies
0	seemed
0	to
0	be
0	observed
0	,
0	for
0	there
0	were
0	several
0	partitions
0	made
0	of
0	skins
0	.

0	among
0	which
0	were
0	some
0	household
0	utensils
0	,
0	and
0	prints
0	for
0	impressing
0	their
0	cloth
0	.

0	These
0	two
0	principles
0	will
0	contribute
0	to
0	explain
0	the
0	phenomenon
0	.

0	the
0	young
0	princesses
0	,
0	the
0	chiefs
0	,
0	and
0	even
0	the
0	king
0	himself
0	joining
0	in
0	the
0	chorus
0	.

0	some
0	of
0	which
0	he
0	purchased
0	from
0	us
0	,
0	as
0	we
0	thought
0	,
0	at
0	great
0	prices
0	;

0	This
0	previous
0	observation
0	therefore
0	,
0	will
0	enable
0	us
0	to
0	form
0	a
0	just
0	idea
0	of
0	each
0	of
0	the
0	above
0	unimproved
0	,
0	rude
0	lands
0	.

0	Next
0	day
0	,
0	before
0	nine
0	in
0	the
0	morning
0	,
0	more
0	than
0	a
0	thousand
0	Indians
0	surrounded
0	the
0	Discovery
0	,
0	insomuch
0	that
0	pressing
0	their
0	weight
0	chiefly
0	on
0	one
0	side
0	,
0	the
0	ship
0	was
0	in
0	danger
0	of
0	being
0	over-set
0	.

0	To
0	allay
0	his
0	thirst
0	,
0	he
0	thought
0	of
0	chewing
0	the
0	stems
0	of
0	a
0	reed
0	,
0	that
0	had
0	a
0	saccharine
0	taste
0	,
0	and
0	was
0	probably
0	a
0	wild
0	kind
0	of
0	sugar-cane
0	,
0	which
0	gave
0	him
0	some
0	refreshment
0	,
0	and
0	contributed
0	not
0	a
0	little
0	to
0	his
0	preservation
0	.

0	On
0	the
0	3d
0	,
0	the
0	wind
0	shifted
0	W.
0	S.
0	W.
0	and
0	a
0	storm
0	came
0	on
0	,
0	preceded
0	by
0	a
0	louring
0	darkness
0	,
0	that
0	presaged
0	some
0	violent
0	convulsion
0	;

0	nay
0	,
0	the
0	very
0	bosom
0	of
0	this
0	immense
0	element
0	seemed
0	to
0	be
0	pregnant
0	with
0	this
0	shining
0	appearance
0	.

0	On
0	the
0	23d
0	,
0	the
0	weather
0	being
0	clear
0	and
0	pleasant
0	,
0	and
0	there
0	being
0	little
0	or
0	no
0	wind
0	,
0	the
0	boats
0	were
0	ordered
0	out
0	,
0	and
0	all
0	hands
0	were
0	employed
0	in
0	fishing
0	,
0	except
0	the
0	Gentlemen
0	,
0	who
0	preferred
0	the
0	diversion
0	of
0	shooting
0	.

0	From
0	this
0	settlement
PERSON-B	Capt.
PERSON-I	Cook
0	received
0	a
0	very
0	singular
0	pre
0	+
0	sent
0	.

0	About
0	four
0	in
0	the
0	afternoon
0	of
0	the
0	20th
0	,
0	ten
0	girls
0	came
0	down
0	to
0	the
0	well
0	,
0	where
0	the
0	waterers
0	were
0	busy
0	,
0	with
0	quantities
0	of
0	fruit
0	,
0	as
0	much
0	as
0	they
0	could
0	carry
0	,
0	for
0	which
0	they
0	would
0	take
0	nothing
0	in
0	return
0	,
0	only
0	praying
0	to
0	be
0	taken
0	on
0	board
0	.

0	because
0	in
0	order
0	to
0	form
0	an
0	idea
0	of
0	the
0	origin
0	of
0	the
0	great
0	ice
0	masses
0	agreeably
0	to
0	what
0	is
0	observed
0	in
0	the
0	Northern
0	hemisphere
0	,
0	they
0	find
0	that
0	the
0	first
0	(
0	point
0	d
0	ppui
0	)
0	point
0	for
0	fixing
0	the
0	high
0	ice
0	islands
0	is
0	the
0	land
0	,
0	and
0	secondly
0	that
0	the
0	great
0	quantity
0	of
0	flat
0	ice
0	is
0	brought
0	down
0	the
0	rivers
0	.
0	"

0	It
0	being
0	summer
0	,
0	we
0	had
0	no
0	access
0	to
0	their
0	winter
0	dwellings
0	,
0	which
0	were
0	all
0	shut
0	up
0	,
0	and
0	they
0	were
0	not
0	over
0	fond
0	of
0	exposing
0	their
0	poverty
0	;

0	We
0	were
0	now
0	preparing
0	to
0	depart
0	,
0	when
0	provisions
0	of
0	all
0	sorts
0	came
0	pouring
0	in
0	upon
0	us
0	faster
0	than
0	we
0	could
0	consume
0	them
0	.

0	On
0	the
0	13th
0	,
0	we
0	passed
0	the
0	fort
0	,
0	and
0	saluted
0	the
0	garrison
0	with
0	13
0	four
0	pounders
0	,
0	which
0	they
0	answered
0	with
0	an
0	equal
0	number
0	.

0	It
0	highly
0	deserves
0	to
0	be
0	examined
0	on
0	many
0	accounts
0	,
0	and
0	though
0	the
0	remarks
0	we
0	have
0	to
0	make
0	on
0	it
0	are
0	but
0	few
0	and
0	perhaps
0	trivial
0	,
0	we
0	will
0	venture
0	to
0	communicate
0	them
0	,
0	as
0	they
0	may
0	serve
0	to
0	confirm
0	some
0	known
0	positions
0	.

0	Hence
0	it
0	is
0	,
0	that
0	sailors
0	are
0	enabled
0	to
0	judge
0	of
0	the
0	populousness
0	of
0	a
0	country
0	by
0	the
0	number
0	of
0	these
0	fires
0	that
0	are
0	seen
0	from
0	the
0	shore
0	.

0	It
0	is
0	natural
0	for
0	men
0	,
0	who
0	have
0	just
0	experienced
0	any
0	signal
0	deliverance
0	,
0	to
0	feel
0	poignantly
0	for
0	the
0	safety
0	of
0	others
0	under
0	the
0	same
0	critical
0	circumstances
0	.

0	About
0	four
0	in
0	the
0	afternoon
0	,
0	we
0	came
0	to
0	an
0	anchor
0	in
0	18
0	fathom
0	water
0	,
0	and
0	were
0	surrounded
0	with
0	Indians
0	who
0	came
0	to
0	plunder
0	;

0	and
0	,
0	being
0	pretty
0	well
0	plied
0	with
0	liquor
0	,
0	they
0	slept
0	on
0	board
0	the
0	Resolution
0	,
0	and
0	next
0	day
0	came
0	on
0	board
0	the
0	Discovery
0	,
0	where
0	they
0	dined
0	,
0	and
0	,
0	being
0	amply
0	supplied
0	with
0	grog
0	,
0	went
0	jovially
0	away
0	in
0	the
0	afternoon
0	.

0	Early
0	in
0	the
0	morning
0	of
0	the
0	next
0	day
0	,
0	(
0	the
0	two
0	men
0	being
0	still
0	missing
0	)
0	the
0	whole
0	party
0	assembled
0	,
0	and
0	the
0	plan
0	of
0	their
0	proceeding
0	was
0	formed
0	.

0	Both
0	Captains
0	very
0	readily
0	embraced
0	the
0	offer
0	,
0	and
0	prepared
0	to
0	accompany
0	their
0	benefactors
0	to
0	the
0	town
0	near
0	which
0	they
0	wished
0	to
0	pitch
0	their
0	tents
0	.

0	The
0	plains
0	from
0	the
0	shores
0	to
0	the
0	foot
0	of
0	the
0	hills
0	,
0	are
0	covered
0	with
0	a
0	very
0	fine
0	thick
0	stratum
0	of
0	black
0	mould
0	,
0	mixed
0	with
0	the
0	above-mentioned
0	kind
0	of
0	sand
0	,
0	and
0	when
0	the
0	natives
0	cultivate
0	some
0	spots
0	for
0	raising
0	the
0	inebriating
0	pepper
0	plant
0	(
0	piper
0	methysticum
0	)
0	or
0	the
0	cloth
0	plant
0	(
0	morus
0	papyrisera
0	)
0	they
0	often
0	use
0	shells
0	as
0	a
0	kind
0	of
0	manure
0	.

0	Course
0	all
0	day
0	S.
0	S.
0	E.
0	Saw
0	many
0	very
0	high
0	trees
0	,
0	supposed
0	to
0	be
0	pines
0	.

0	Here
0	some
0	of
0	our
0	former
0	friends
0	came
0	off
0	to
0	us
0	,
0	and
0	being
0	informed
0	that
0	our
0	design
0	was
0	to
0	anchor
0	in
0	our
0	late
0	harbour
0	,
0	they
0	undertook
0	to
0	be
0	our
0	pilots
0	,
0	and
0	one
0	of
0	them
0	slept
0	all
0	night
0	on
0	board
0	the
0	Discovery
0	.

0	They
0	had
0	not
0	hitherto
0	discovered
0	any
0	disposition
0	to
0	pilfer
0	;

0	On
0	the
0	17th
0	the
0	weather
0	began
0	to
0	grow
0	pierceing
0	cold
0	.

0	When
0	the
0	volcano
0	made
0	an
0	explosion
0	,
0	we
0	always
0	saw
0	a
0	new
0	quantity
0	of
0	vapours
0	and
0	steams
0	pierce
0	these
0	spiracula
0	,
0	which
0	are
0	apparently
0	shut
0	up
0	,
0	but
0	seem
0	to
0	have
0	a
0	cavity
0	underneath
0	;

0	And
0	when
0	they
0	had
0	attained
0	the
0	summit
0	of
0	the
0	eminence
0	,
0	was
0	exceedingly
0	picturesque
0	.

0	The
0	other
0	seemed
0	to
0	be
0	picked
0	men
0	,
0	and
0	rather
0	under
0	than
0	above
0	the
0	middle
0	age
0	.

0	and
0	there
0	may
0	be
0	likewise
0	some
0	shrimps
0	and
0	other
0	insects
0	,
0	×
0	that
0	are
0	phosphorescent
0	,
0	though
0	I
0	have
0	never
0	seen
0	them
0	.

0	If
0	I
0	except
0	the
0	coral
0	rocks
0	and
0	madrepores
0	,
0	which
0	form
0	the
0	shores
0	of
0	a
0	great
0	many
0	of
0	these
0	isles
0	,
0	I
0	cannot
0	say
0	,
0	that
0	I
0	met
0	with
0	a
0	single
0	petrefaction
0	of
0	any
0	denomination
0	,
0	in
0	all
0	,
0	the
0	isles
0	we
0	visited
0	in
0	the
0	course
0	of
0	our
0	expedition
0	.

0	yet
0	by
0	a
0	little
0	encouragement
0	,
0	increasing
0	their
0	allowance
0	of
0	grog
0	,
0	and
0	giving
0	them
0	plenty
0	of

0	,
0	they
0	continued
0	their
0	labour
0	with
0	cheerfulness
0	and
0	astonishing
0	perseverance
0	.

0	While
0	we
0	were
0	hovering
0	upon
0	the
0	coast
0	,
0	we
0	had
0	often
0	been
0	visited
0	by
0	200
0	canoes
0	at
0	a
0	time
0	,
0	who
0	came
0	to
0	trade
0	,
0	and
0	who
0	brought
0	us
0	provisions
0	when
0	the
0	weather
0	would
0	permit
0	;

0	But
0	they
0	had
0	still
0	a
0	journey
0	of
0	about
0	seven
0	or
0	eight
0	miles
0	to
0	perform
0	,
0	before
0	they
0	could
0	reach
0	the
0	place
0	from
0	whence
0	they
0	set
0	out
0	.

0	This
0	was
0	denied
0	them
0	,
0	as
0	peremptory
0	orders
0	had
0	been
0	given
0	by
PERSON-B	Capt.
PERSON-I	Clerke
0	,
0	forbidding
0	the

0	of
0	any
0	more

0	their

0	.

0	In
0	a
0	moment
0	a
0	sailor
0	was
0	perched
0	at
0	the
0	top
0	of
0	every
0	lofty
0	tree
0	in
0	sight
0	,
0	and
0	the
0	high

0	descried
0	,
0	seemingly
0	at
0	no
0	great

0	from
0	the

0	the

0	and
PERSON-B	Capt.
PERSON-I	Cook
0	,
0	perceiving
0	he
0	was
0	going
0	on

0	,
0	followed
0	him
0	,
0	and
0	arrived
0	nearly
0	at
0	the

0	.

0	Every

0	in
0	this

0	,
0	of
0	which
0	there
0	are
0	more

0	appeared
0	to
0	be
0	well

0	.

0	To

0	seen
0	small

0	of

0	.

0	Some
0	of

0	with

0	of
0	a

0	,
0	who
0	went
0	with

0	on
0	this

0	,
0	in
0	having
0	executed
0	some
0	of
0	these
0	romantic
0	landscapes
0	in
0	a
0	masterly
0	manner
0	.

0	No

0	our

0	from
0	the
0	horrible
0	situation
0	we
0	were
0	in
0	.

0	Their
0	eyes
0	were
0	made
0	of

0	,
0	with
0	a

0	fixed
0	in

0	Over

0	was
0	an

0	situated

0	The

0	of
0	this

0	but
0	the

0	no
0	water
0	,
0	no

0	we
0	made
0	use
0	of
PERSON-B	Dr.
PERSON-I	Irving
0	's
0	distilling
0	machine
0	,
0	we
0	likewise
0	found
0	,
0	that
0	the
0	water
0	thus
0	distilled
0	was
0	not
0	only
0	entirely
0	freed
0	from
0	its
0	salt
0	,
0	but
0	,
0	besides
0	this
0	,
0	we
0	never

0	discover
0	the
0	least
0	bitter

0	in
0	the
0	drinkable

0	.

0	In
0	high

0	the

0	sometimes
0	,
0	sometimes
0	very

0	We

0	scarce
0	dropt
0	anchor
0	,
0	when
0	the
0	Governor
0	came
0	on

0	,
0	bringing
0	with
0	him
0	a
0	packet
0	of
0	letters
0	for
PERSON-B	Capt.
PERSON-I	Cook
0	,
0	which
0	had
0	lain
0	there
0	ever
0	since
0	the
0	beginning
0	of
0	1779
0	;

0	and
0	we
0	found
0	that
0	they
0	were
0	in
0	great
0	estimation
0	with
0	their
0	owners
0	,
0	for
0	they
0	would
0	not
0	at
0	first
0	part
0	with
0	one
0	of
0	them
0	for
0	any
0	thing
0	that
0	we
0	offered
0	,
0	asking
0	no
0	less
0	for
0	each
0	than
0	a
0	musket
0	.

0	On
0	the
0	22d
0	we
0	were
0	overjoyed
0	,
0	on
0	sounding
0	,
0	to
0	find
0	the
0	sea
0	deepen
0	to
0	forty
0	fathom
0	;

0	c.
0	began
0	to
0	overhaul
0	the
0	rigging
0	,
0	and
0	all
0	hands
0	were
0	employed
0	in
0	different
0	repairs
0	.

0	The
0	thicket
0	in
0	many
0	places
0	was
0	overgrown
0	with
0	thick
0	grass
0	and
0	brambles
0	reaching
0	;

0	and
0	when
0	overcome
0	with
0	fatigue
0	,
0	they
0	sat
0	down
0	to
0	refresh
0	,
0	and
0	he
0	believed
0	had
0	drank
0	a
0	little
0	too
0	freely
0	of
0	the
0	grog
0	they
0	had
0	in
0	charge
0	,
0	for
0	they
0	both
0	fell
0	asleep
0	.

0	The
0	old
0	Indian
0	did
0	not
0	seem
0	willing
0	to
0	shew
0	the
0	gentlemen
0	the
0	inside
0	of
0	the
0	houses
0	,
0	nor
0	were
0	they
0	over-solicitous
0	to
0	examine
0	them
0	.

0	This
0	day
0	,
PERSON-B	Capt.
PERSON-I	Cook
0	landed
0	on
0	a
0	narrow
0	border
0	of
0	land
0	which
0	joined
0	to
0	the
0	beech
0	,
0	and
0	which
0	was
0	covered
0	with
0	grass
0	and
0	heath
0	,
0	with
0	a
0	variety
0	of
0	wild
0	berries
0	,
0	but
0	rather
0	over-ripe
0	.

0	but
0	he
0	instantly
0	jumped
0	over-board
0	,
0	and
0	gave
0	it
0	to
0	one
0	of
0	his
0	companions
0	,
0	who
0	was
0	making
0	off
0	with
0	it
0	,
0	till
0	fired
0	at
0	with
0	small
0	shot
0	,
0	which
0	brought
0	him
0	back
0	;

0	Near
PLACE-B	Turtle-Island
0	we
0	saw
0	an
0	oblong
0	reef
0	,
0	which
0	was
0	no
0	where
0	free
0	from
0	water
0	,
0	had
0	a
0	deep
0	sea
0	included
0	,
0	and
0	on
0	its
0	outsides
0	there
0	was
0	a
0	great
0	depth
0	close
0	to
0	the
0	reef
0	.

0	Whosoever
0	casts
0	a
0	glance
0	on
PLACE-B	Africa
0	and
0	New-Holland
0	,
0	must
0	,
0	upon
0	the
0	whole
0	,
0	be
0	struck
0	with
0	the
0	similarity
0	of
0	their
0	general
0	outlines
0	;

0	This
0	kind
0	of
0	ice
0	may
0	well
0	be
0	distinguished
0	from
0	the
0	more
0	solid
0	forts
0	both
0	by
0	its
0	appearance
0	and
0	by
0	its
0	situation
0	,
0	as
0	it
0	commonly
0	is
0	the
0	outermost
0	at
0	the
0	approach
0	of
0	any
0	large
0	quantity
0	of
0	ice
0	,
0	and
0	therefore
0	more
0	exposed
0	to
0	the
0	agitation
0	of
0	the
0	waves
0	.

0	This
0	happened
0	to
0	be
0	the
0	outer
0	border
0	that
0	skirted
0	the
0	lagoon
0	,
0	which
0	when
0	he
0	had
0	penetrated
0	,
0	and
0	found
0	an
0	opening
0	,
0	his
0	heart
0	leaped
0	within
0	him
0	;

0	The
0	7th
0	,
0	the
0	sea
0	all
0	round
0	was
0	covered
0	with
0	pumice
0	stones
0	floating
0	to
0	the
0	Northward
0	,
0	several
0	pieces
0	of
0	which
0	being
0	taken
0	up
0	,
0	weighed
0	from
0	one
0	ounce
0	to
0	three
0	pounds
0	.

0	They
0	have
0	otters
0	in
0	their
0	lakes
0	,
0	but
0	their
0	skins
0	bear
0	a
0	great
0	price
0	.

0	Their
0	great
0	object
0	is
0	the
0	sea-beaver
0	or
0	otter
0	.

0	sometimes
0	so
0	intensely
0	red
0	,
0	that
0	the
0	natives
0	use
0	it
0	to
0	paint
0	their
0	canoes
0	and
0	cloth
0	:
0	and
0	in
0	this
0	earth
0	I
0	found
0	here
0	and
0	there
0	pieces
0	,
0	as
0	I
0	believe
0	of
0	the
0	osteocella
0	(
0	tophus
0	osteocolla
0	Linn
0	.
0	)
0	.

0	The
0	acid
0	of
0	phosphorus
0	disengaged
0	by
0	putrefaction
0	from
0	its
0	original
0	mixture
0	in
0	animal
0	bodies
0	,
0	may
0	easily
0	combine
0	with
0	some
0	of
0	the
0	just
0	mentioned
0	inflammables
0	,
0	and
0	thus
0	produce
0	a
0	phosphorus
0	floating
0	on
0	the
0	top
0	of
0	the
0	ocean
0	,
0	and
0	causing
0	that
0	luminous
0	appearance
0	,
0	which
0	we
0	so
0	much
0	admire
0	.

0	The
0	cat-silver
0	is
0	sometimes
0	of
0	an
0	intensely
0	red
0	or
0	orange
0	colour
0	,
0	by
0	means
0	of
0	an
0	iron-ochre
0	.

0	but
0	,
0	in
0	case
0	the
0	thaw
0	continues
0	,
0	and
0	it
0	ceases
0	entirely
0	to
0	freeze
0	,
0	the
0	same
0	transparent
0	ice
0	become
0	soft
0	and
0	porous
0	,
0	and
0	turns
0	again
0	entirely
0	opaque.Q
0	This
0	,
0	I
0	believe
0	,
0	may
0	be
0	applicable
0	to
0	the
0	ice
0	seen
0	by
0	us
0	in
0	the
0	ocean
0	.

0	December
0	1st
0	,
0	about
0	two
0	in
0	the
0	afternoon
0	,
0	after
0	a
0	passage
0	of
0	one-and-twenty
0	days
0	,
0	we
0	cast
0	anchor
0	within
0	four
0	miles
0	of
0	the
0	harbour
0	,
0	where
0	we
0	were
0	met
0	by
0	two
0	Chinese
0	gentlemen
0	,
0	who
0	told
0	us
0	of
0	the

0	war
0	,
0	and

0	the
0	eastward
0	,
0	to
0	clear
0	the

0	,
0	but
0	made
0	little

0	,
0	though
0	a
0	storm
0	came
0	on
0	,
0	which
0	lasted
0	till
0	next
0	day
0	.

0	He
0	appeared
0	by
0	far
0	the
0	oldest
0	man
0	they
0	had
0	seen
0	on

0	Iron

0	weapons
0	of

0	to

0	introduced
0	among

0	.

0	The
0	first

0	If
0	therefore
0	we
0	should
0	even
0	suppose
0	,
0	that
0	the

0	from

0	upwards
0	,

0	,
0	be
0	intirely
0	occupied
0	by

0	,
0	this

0	inconsiderable
0	to
0	counterpoise
0	the

0	.

0	We

0	In

0	The

PERSON-B	Mr.

0	So

0	not

0	The

0	They

0	the
0	rather

0	Our

0	was
0	therefore
0	collected

0	,
0	having
0	landed
0	under

0	of
0	our

0	,
0	we
0	marched
0	rapidly
0	up
0	the
0	hill
0	,
0	with
0	bayonets
0	fixed
0	,
0	and
0	took

0	,
0	which
0	stood
0	on

0	,

0	The

0	lost

0	On
0	the

0	,
0	it
0	began
0	to

0	,

0	In

0	they
0	soon

0	Our

0	The

0	but
0	in
0	launching
0	it
0	the

0	,
0	we
0	observed
0	the
0	stock
0	of
0	our
0	best
0	bower
0	to
0	be
0	sprung
0	.

0	It
0	is
0	hard

0	which
0	was

0	,
0	their
0	joy
0	,
0	their

0	.

0	These

0	were
0	no

0	than
0	square

0	dug
0	in

0	,
0	and
0	latticed
0	with
0	rough

0	,
0	over
0	which
0	were
0	laid
0	sods

0	,
0	leaving
0	a

0	in

0	like
0	a

0	.

0	We
0	came
0	on
0	the
0	same
0	morning
0	,
0	Aug.
0	the
0	18th
0	,
0	half
0	an

0	,
0	to

0	.

0	They
0	had
0	spears
0	also
0	,
0	and
0	lances
0	headed
0	with
0	iron
0	,
0	very
0	neatly
0	manufactured
0	,
0	and
0	knives
0	,
0	which
0	they
0	kept
0	as
0	bright
0	as
0	silver
0	;

0	but
0	in
0	the
0	winter
0	they
0	shut
0	themselves
0	up
0	close
0	,
0	and
0	have
0	lamps
0	,
0	which
0	they
0	continually

0	:
0	for
0	here
0	,
0	during
0	the
0	winter
0	months
0	,
0	they
0	scarce
0	ever
0	see
0	the
0	sun
0	.

0	They
0	likewise
0	brought
0	several
0	sharks
0	,
0	which
0	they
0	found
0	in
0	such
0	crowds
0	,
0	that
0	they
0	knocked
0	them
0	on
0	the
0	head
0	with
0	their
0	oars
0	.

0	On
0	one
0	side
0	of

0	their

0	and
0	on

0	some

0	,
0	and
0	others
0	to

0	,
0	in

0	to
0	be
0	kindled
0	at
0	the
0	close
0	of
0	day
0	,
0	and
0	kept
0	burning
0	during
0	the
0	night
0	,
0	by

0	of

0	,
0	to

0	,
0	if
0	alive
0	,
0	where
0	to

0	;

0	In
0	these
0	they
0	never

0	at
0	some
0	distance
0	,
0	chiefly
0	in
0	the
0	night
0	,
0	but
0	for
0	what

0	we
0	could
0	never
0	learn
0	.

0	The
0	few
0	cocoa-nut
0	trees
0	that
0	were
0	found
0	upon
0	it
0	,
0	produced
0	hardly

0	,
0	except

0	on

0	already

0	what

0	but
0	these
0	,

0	by

0	and
0	some

0	,
0	are
0	no
0	doubt
0	found
0	in
0	several
0	of

0	:
0	but
0	the
0	mountains
0	of
PLACE-B	New-Caledonia
0	are
0	the
0	most
0	likely
0	to

0	;

0	nay
0	,
0	one

0	or
0	rather
0	the

0	of

0	,
0	which

0	but
0	such

0	they

0	,

0	carried
0	off
0	in
0	triumph
0	the

0	though
0	at

0	we
0	saw

0	though
0	an

0	,
0	and
0	to

0	in

0	:
0	for
0	by
0	this
0	storm
0	a
0	leak
0	was
0	discovered
0	in
0	the
0	Resolution
0	,
0	which
0	,
0	had
0	it
0	been
0	calm

0	,
0	would
0	probably
0	have
0	proved
0	fatal
0	to
0	the

0	which
0	evidently
0	evinces
0	,
0	in
0	my

0	,
0	that
0	ice
0	is
0	there
0	formed
0	or
0	generated
0	where
0	the

0	is
0	;

0	but
0	,
0	before
0	a
0	few
0	hours
0	were
0	elapsed
0	,
0	even
0	the
0	gentlemen
0	,
0	who
0	were
0	inspirited
0	by
0	their
0	success
0	in
0	killing
0	game
0	,
0	began
0	to
0	be
0	tired
0	,
0	and
0	it
0	was
0	thought
0	adviseable
0	to
0	rest
0	and
0	refresh
0	during
0	the
0	middle
0	of
0	the

0	and
0	to
0	renew
0	the

0	.

0	We
0	returned
0	the
0	civility
0	,
0	but
0	this
0	did
0	not
0	inspire
0	them
0	with
0	sufficient

0	;

0	Some
0	of
0	them
0	grew
0	insolent
0	as
0	he
0	made
0	his
0	complaints
0	;

0	But
0	here
0	they
0	boil
0	it
0	with
0	hot
0	stones
0	immersed
0	in
0	water
0	,
0	by
0	which
0	its
0	flavour
0	is
0	rendered
0	more
0	insipid
0	.

0	nor
0	was
0	he
0	insensible
0	of
0	our

0	.

0	The
0	natives
0	are
0	a
0	quiet
0	inoffensive
0	people
0	,
0	and
0	for
0	honesty
0	might
0	serve
0	as
0	an

0	to
0	the

0	and

0	We

0	and
0	continued
0	working
0	off
0	the

0	all
0	night

0	soon
0	lost

0	,

0	,
0	for

0	The

0	When

0	to

0	anxiety
0	at
0	seeing
0	the

0	,
0	or

0	.

0	but
0	we
0	soon

0	not
0	to

0	a

0	This
0	part
0	of
0	the

0	,
0	they
0	all
0	made
0	a

0	in

0	This
0	was

0	but

0	the

0	that

0	follow
0	,
0	both

0	met
0	on

0	some
0	of
0	which
0	were

0	We

0	The

0	soon
0	came
0	about

0	to

0	they

0	,
0	that
0	iron
0	was
0	what
0	they
0	valued
0	most
0	.

0	and
0	we
0	made
0	the
0	signal
0	for
0	the
0	Discovery
0	to
0	go
0	on
0	our
0	hull-beam
0	in

0	found

0	Towards
0	the

0	of
0	the
0	29th
0	,
0	he

0	he
0	heard
0	the

0	of
0	dogs
0	;

0	and
0	a
0	house-keeper
0	and
0	cook
0	;

0	Here
0	we
0	were
0	received
0	with
0	much

0	and
0	hospitality
0	;

0	Being
0	asked
0	,
0	if
0	any
0	part
0	of
0	the
0	flesh
0	had
0	been
0	eaten
0	,
0	they
0	expressed
0	the
0	utmost
0	horror
0	at
0	the
0	idea
0	.

0	To
0	the
0	West
0	of
0	our
0	anchoring-place
0	,
0	near
0	the

0	,
0	are

0	horn-stone
0	(

0	and
0	,
0	besides
0	these
0	caps
0	,
0	which
0	most
0	of
0	them
0	wore
0	,
0	we
0	got
0	from
0	them
0	some
0	hoods
0	made
0	of
0	the
0	skins
0	of
0	dogs
0	,
0	large
0	enough
0	to
0	cover
0	both
0	head
0	and
0	shoulders
0	.

0	His
0	attendants
0	helped
0	him
0	into
0	the
0	ship
0	,
0	and
0	placed
0	him
0	on
0	the
0	gangway
0	,
0	where
0	they
0	stood
0	round
0	him
0	,
0	holding
0	each
0	other
0	by
0	the
0	hands
0	;

0	but
0	as
0	this
0	great
0	natural
0	historian
0	says
0	,
0	that
0	the
0	Black
0	Sea
0	is
0	the
0	only
0	instance
0	of
0	a
0	sea
0	being
0	entirely
0	frozen
0	;

0	The

0	may
0	,
0	however
0	,
0	serve
0	to
0	future

0	as
0	a

0	of
0	what

0	still
0	wanted
0	to
0	be
0	observed
0	,
0	relative
0	to
0	the
0	saltness
0	of
0	the
0	ocean
0	.

0	Thus
0	surrounded
0	,
0	a
0	signal
0	was
0	made
0	from
0	the
0	Resolution
0	to
0	bring
0	to
0	,
0	and
0	to
0	load
0	the
0	great
0	guns
0	,
0	while
0	the
0	boats
0	were
0	getting
0	ready
0	to
0	attack
0	these
0	hideous
0	looking
0	creatures
0	with
0	muskets
0	.

0	The
0	Orator
0	made
0	not
0	the
0	least
0	hesitation
0	,
0	but
0	mounted
0	the
0	ship
0	's
0	side
0	,
0	and
0	accosted
0	the
0	Captain
0	with
0	much
0	civility
0	,
0	and
0	after
0	receiving
0	some
0	presents
0	,
0	and
0	stopping
0	a
0	little
0	while
0	to
0	observe
0	the
0	artificers
0	,
0	he
0	took
0	a
0	very
0	polite
0	leave
0	,
0	descended
0	to
0	his
0	boat
0	,
0	and
0	was
0	landed
0	on
0	the
0	opposite
0	shore
0	of
0	the
PLACE-B	Sound
0	.

0	In
0	the
0	course
0	of
0	their
0	journey
0	,
0	they
0	were
0	directed
0	to
0	the
0	cottage
0	of
0	an
0	old
0	hermit
0	,
0	who
0	,
0	they
0	said
0	,
0	had
0	formerly
0	been
0	a
0	great
0	warrior
0	;

0	who
0	had
0	no
0	sooner
0	finished
0	their
0	song
0	than
0	they
0	all
0	fell
0	at
0	his
0	feet
0	,
PERSON-B	the
PERSON-I	King
0	acquainting
0	him
0	,
0	that
0	this

0	,
0	and
0	that
0	he
0	was
0	from
0	henceforth
0	their
0	Orono
0	.

0	but
0	they
0	had
0	hardly
0	left
0	the
0	ship
0	,
0	when
0	another
0	body
0	of
0	Indians
0	appeared
0	,
0	more
0	than
0	double
0	the
0	number
0	of
0	the
0	former
0	,
0	who
0	hemmed
0	them
0	all
0	into
0	the
0	cove
0	,
0	and
0	stript
0	them
0	of
0	every

0	they

0	about
0	them
0	,
0	and
0	then
0	came
0	and
0	traded
0	with
0	us
0	.

0	After
0	they
0	had
0	been
0	well
0	rubbed

0	and
0	now

0	upon

0	,
0	a

0	N.
0	we
0	passed
0	two

0	one

0	We
0	were
0	now
0	obliged
0	to
0	come
0	to
0	anchor
0	,
0	as
0	a
0	heavy
0	snow
0	darkened

0	but

0	expecting

0	let

0	On

0	We

0	—
0	The
0	truth
0	is
0	,
0	the
0	Priests
0	had
0	desired
0	the

0	to

0	lest

0	,
0	by
0	which
0	they

0	have
0	been
0	discovered
0	,
0	and
0	perhaps
0	put
0	to
0	death
0	.

0	Here
0	they
0	determined
0	to
0	pass
0	the

0	within
0	a

0	.

0	The

0	were
0	not

0	,
0	but
0	they
0	disfigured

0	;

0	for
0	a

0	came
0	on
0	,
0	when
0	our
0	whole

0	depended
0	upon
0	the

0	of

0	.

0	unknown
0	,
0	at

0	,
0	to

0	:
0	though
0	we
0	shall
0	see

0	,
0	that
0	it
0	was
0	not
0	wholly

0	Asiatic
0	Russians
0	.

0	gaining
0	upon

0	considerably
0	,
0	though
0	every
0	man
0	in
0	the
0	ship
0	,
0	even
0	to
0	the

0	,
0	took
0	it
0	in

0	to

0	at

0	;

0	He
0	presently
0	discovered
0	that

0	had
0	another

0	to
0	furmount
0	,
0	before
0	he
0	could
0	reach
0	the
0	summit
0	of
0	his
0	wishes
0	.

0	so
0	that
0	what
0	with
0	the
0	closeness
0	of
0	our
0	confinement
0	,
0	and
0	the
0	sulphureous
0	fumes
0	from
0	the
0	ashes
0	,
0	we
0	were
0	almost
0	suffocated
0	.

0	On
0	the
0	29th
0	,
0	about
0	eight
0	,
0	A.
0	M.
0	we

0	in

0	a
0	whole

0	of
0	small
0	craft
0	,
0	which
0	we
0	took
0	to
0	be
0	fshing-vessels
0	.

0	This
0	attempt
0	was
0	accordingly
0	frustrated
0	.

0	On

0	out

0	,
0	with

0	,
0	piercing

0	and

0	was
0	at
0	that
0	time
0	likewise
0	,
0	that
0	we
0	commonly
0	noticed
0	flights

PERSON-B	Capt.
PERSON-I	Cook
0	himself
0	being
0	upon
0	deck
0	when
0	we
0	came
0	up
0	,
0	informed

0	that
0	he
0	had
0	sprung
0	his
0	fore-mast
0	in
0	two
0	different
0	places
0	;

0	he
0	catched

0	and
0	laying

0	across
0	two
0	pieces
0	of
0	ice
0	,
0	recovered
0	his

0	.

0	We
0	were
0	once
0	more
0	flattered
0	with
0	having
0	found
0	the

0	,
0	〈

0	which

0	being
0	now
0	in
0	the
0	latitude
0	of
0	60
0	degrees
0	north
0	.

0	As
0	we
0	now
0	began
0	to
0	approach
0	the
0	higher
0	Northern
0	latitudes
0	,
0	the
0	flannel
0	jackets
0	that
0	had
0	been
0	stored
0	up
0	while
0	we
0	were
0	among

0	tropical
0	islands
0	,
0	were
0	again
0	brought
0	into

0	,
0	and
0	were
0	of
0	infinite
0	service
0	to
0	the
0	poor
0	men
0	.

0	Our
0	ships
0	were
0	ill
0	fitted
0	for

0	One
0	of
0	our
0	visitors
0	,
0	in
0	the
0	course
0	of
0	trade
0	,
0	offered
0	some
0	fish-hooks
0	to
0	sell
0	.

0	By
0	the
0	large
0	fish-bones
0	,
0	and
0	of
0	other
0	sea-animals
0	,
0	that
0	lay
0	scattered
0	about
0	,
0	it
0	appears
0	,
0	that
0	the
0	sea
0	supplies
0	them
0	with
0	the
0	greatest
0	part
0	of
0	their
0	substance
0	.

0	They
0	are
0	filthy
0	beyond
0	imagination
0	.

0	We
0	sounded
0	at
0	fifty-four
0	fathom
0	,
0	and
0	bore
0	away
0	W.
0	S.
0	W.
0	keeping
0	a
0	proper
0	distance
0	from
0	the
0	reefs
0	,
0	and
0	coasting
0	along
0	till
0	we
0	passed
0	them
0	.

0	These
0	were
0	fierce
0	animals
0	,
0	and
0	were
0	not
0	easily
0	brought
0	on
0	board
0	;

0	The
0	field-ice
0	was
0	commonly
0	opaque
0	;

0	but
0	,
0	in
0	our
0	situation
0	,
0	that
0	was
0	a
0	work
0	of
0	no
0	small
0	labour
0	and
0	difficulty
0	,
0	as
0	at
0	this
0	time
0	many
0	of
0	our
0	hands
0	,
0	through
0	fatigue
0	,
0	and
0	being
0	constantly
0	exposed
0	to
0	the
0	rain
0	and
0	snow
0	,
0	and
0	in
0	a
0	damp
0	ship
0	,
0	were
0	ill
0	of
0	colds
0	,
0	attended
0	with
0	slow
0	fevers
0	,
0	which
0	rendered
0	them
0	incapable
0	of
0	duty
0	.

0	In
0	the
0	winter
0	the
0	men
0	are
0	employed
0	in
0	hunting
0	,
0	making
0	sledges
0	,
0	and
0	fetching
0	wood
0	;

0	full
0	of
0	caverns
0	,
0	and
0	some
0	ferrugineous
0	particles
0	.

0	In
0	this
0	condition
0	it
0	is
0	easy
0	to
0	conceive
0	,
0	the
0	fatigues
0	to
0	which
0	the
0	poor
0	sailors
0	were
0	exposed
0	;

0	These
0	huts
0	were
0	only
0	boughs
0	and
0	leaves
0	of
0	trees
0	set
0	up
0	tent
0	fashion
0	.

0	For
0	a
0	door
0	,
0	they
0	had
0	a
0	hole
0	just
0	large
0	enough
0	to
0	creep
0	in
0	at
0	,
0	which
0	,
0	in
0	cold
0	weather
0	,
0	they
0	close
0	with
0	a
0	kind
0	of
0	faggot
0	.

0	but
0	it
0	was
0	some
0	days
0	before
0	he
0	recovered
0	the
0	perfect
0	use
0	of
0	his
0	faculties
0	.

0	and
0	what
0	they
0	had
0	on
0	appeared
0	to
0	be
0	their
0	own
0	manufacture
0	,
0	of
0	which
0	there
0	were
0	various
0	fabricks
0	,
0	and
0	of
0	a
0	variety
0	of
0	colours
0	.

0	These
0	civilities

0	accompanied
0	with
0	the
0	most
0	lively
0	expressions
0	of
0	esteem
0	,
0	at
0	parting
0	;

0	As
0	all

0	was
0	now
0	stopt
0	,
0	and
0	nothing
0	brought
0	on

0	expostulate
0	with
0	the

0	,
0	and
0	by

0	trifling
0	presents
0	to
0	engage
0	them
0	to
0	trade
0	as
0	before
0	;

0	The
0	officer
0	who
0	commanded
0	,
0	and
0	the
0	crew
0	,
0	had
0	waited
0	at
0	the

0	till
0	all
0	their

0	were
0	expended
0	,
0	and
0	the

0	not

0	to

0	,
0	had
0	repaired
0	to
0	the

0	for
0	a

0	,
0	and
0	for

0	,
0	and
0	was
0	now
0	returning
0	fully
0	furnished
0	and
0	instructed
0	.

0	nor
0	could
0	we
0	be
0	mistaken
0	in
0	its
0	situation
0	,
0	as
0	we
0	had
0	been
0	on
0	the

0	for
0	a
0	considerable
0	time

0	,
0	if
0	any
0	had

0	as
0	we
0	had
0	frequent
0	opportunities
0	to
0	ascertain
0	our
0	latitude
0	.

0	and
0	the
0	engineer
0	was
0	ordered
0	to
0	begin
0	his
0	exhibition
0	as
0	soon
0	as
0	it
0	was
0	dark
0	.

0	In
0	their
0	excursion
0	the
0	gentlemen
0	shot
0	two
0	eagles
0	and
0	several
0	other
0	birds
0	of
0	various
0	sorts
0	,
0	and
0	soon
0	returned
0	on
0	board
0	the
0	ships
0	.

0	The
0	same
0	may
0	be
0	said
0	of
PLACE-B	O-Taheitee
0	and
0	all
0	the
PLACE-B	Society
PLACE-I	Isles
0	,
0	which
0	are
0	surrounded
0	by
0	a
0	fertile
0	plain
0	extending
0	from
0	the
0	hills
0	to
0	the
0	sea
0	,
0	and
0	then
0	included
0	in
0	a
0	reef
0	,
0	beyond
0	which
0	the
0	sea
0	immediately
0	becomes
0	excessively
0	deep
0	.

0	they
0	have
0	decoys
0	excellently
0	adapted
0	for
0	entrapping
0	both
0	fish
0	and
0	fowl
0	;

0	The
0	highest
0	point
0	of
0	this
0	hill
0	is
0	at
0	a
0	very
0	just
0	estimate
0	,
0	about
0	seven
0	miles
0	from
PLACE-B	Point
PLACE-I	Venus
0	.

0	and
0	these
0	eruptions
0	are
0	carried
0	by
0	the
0	wind
0	to
0	a
0	great
0	distance
0	,
0	and
0	to
0	the
0	great
0	terror
0	of
0	the
0	inhabitants
0	.

0	On
0	the
0	25th
0	the
0	pinnace
0	from
0	the
0	Resolution
0	was
0	manned
0	,
0	and
0	properly
0	equipped
0	to
0	bring
0	him
0	on
0	board
0	.

0	In
0	this
0	vindictive
0	enterprize
0	,
0	the
0	cavern
0	or
0	hole
0	of
0	the
0	crafty
0	Indian
0	,
0	whose
0	insolence
0	had
0	been
0	one
0	principal
0	cause
0	of
0	the
0	desolation
0	that
0	followed
0	,
0	was
0	not
0	forgotten
0	.

0	The
0	men
0	,
0	though
0	they
0	were
0	no
0	less
0	willing
0	,
0	were
0	not
0	all
0	equally
0	able
0	to
0	endure
0	the
0	fatigue
0	;

0	but
0	their
0	manner
0	of
0	living
0	affords
0	nothing
0	very
0	enchanting
0	for
0	sailors
0	.

0	and
0	here
0	and
0	there
0	I
0	saw
0	fragments
0	of
0	black
0	solid
0	basaltes
0	or
0	paragone
0	,
0	which
0	the
0	natives
0	commonly
0	employ
0	to
0	make
0	their
0	paste
0	beaters
0	,
0	hatchets
0	,
0	chissels
0	and
0	cutting
0	tools
0	.

0	He
0	received
0	them
0	without
0	any
0	kind
0	of
0	emotion
0	,
0	but
0	would
0	accept
0	of
0	nothing
0	that
0	they
0	offered
0	him
0	.

0	We
0	stood
0	to
0	the
0	northward
0	,
0	and
0	being
0	embayed
0	,
0	we
0	observed
0	a
0	large
0	island
0	floating
0	,
0	with
0	the
0	tide
0	towards
0	us
0	,
0	whereon
0	was
0	supposed
0	to
0	rest
0	great
0	numbers
0	of
0	sea-monsters
0	.

0	the
0	beef
0	and
0	pork
0	which
0	we
0	brought
0	from
PLACE-B	England
0	,
0	being
0	now
0	scarce
0	eatable
0	.

0	What
0	they
0	had
0	to
0	dispose
0	of
0	they
0	parted
0	with
0	upon
0	the
0	easiest
0	terms
0	;

0	All
0	hands
0	were
0	now
0	ordered
0	to
0	their
0	posts
0	,
0	and
0	an
0	engagement
0	commenced
0	in
0	earnest
0	,
0	when
0	the
0	Indians
0	instantly
0	gave
0	way
0	,
0	after
0	a
0	few
0	being
0	killed
0	and
0	wounded
0	by
0	our
0	fire
0	;

0	but
0	his
0	joy
0	was
0	or
0	short
0	duration
0	.

0	We
0	then
0	advanced
0	,
0	and
0	entered
0	into
0	a
0	kind
0	of
0	dumb
0	discourse
0	,
0	of
0	which
0	we
0	could
0	understand
0	enough
0	to
0	know
0	that
0	they
0	wanted
0	us
0	to
0	accompany
0	them
0	to
0	their
0	town
0	,
0	which
0	we
0	very
0	readily
0	did
0	;

0	About
0	noon
0	,
0	a
0	pleasant
0	breeze
0	sprung
0	up
0	,
0	and
0	we
0	directed
0	our
0	course
0	to
0	a
0	flag
0	we
0	saw
0	displayed
0	just
0	within
0	the
0	bay
0	,
0	and
0	happily
0	succeeded
0	,
0	drooping
0	our
0	anchor
0	in
0	twenty
0	fathom
0	water
0	,
0	within
0	less
0	than
0	three

0	no

0	would

0	,
0	and
0	frozen

0	were
0	transparent
0	and
0	pellucid
0	;

0	We

0	,
0	not
0	dreaming
0	of
0	the
0	hardships
0	we
0	had
0	yet
0	to
0	suffer
0	,
0	and
0	we
0	pursued

0	The

0	assigned
0	for

0	reception
0	at

0	To

0	and
0	the
0	soundings
0	are
0	deep
0	close
0	into
0	the

0	without

0	.

0	After
0	the
0	water
0	had
0	been
0	standing
0	for
0	a
0	little
0	while
0	,
0	the

0	seemed
0	to
0	decrease

0	,
0	but
0	,
0	by
0	stirring
0	the
0	water
0	again
0	,
0	we
0	observed
0	the
0	whole
0	to
0	be
0	again
0	entirely
0	luminous
0	;

0	Their
0	hair
0	in
0	general
0	was
0	long
0	and
0	black
0	,
0	which
0	they
0	dress
0	and
0	decorate
0	with
0	feathers
0	and
0	down
0	.

0	The
0	same
0	evening
0	,
0	John
0	M
0	'Intosh
0	,
0	the
0	carpenter
0	,
0	mate
0	of
0	the
0	Resolution
0	died
0	,
0	and
0	was
0	decently
0	buried
0	,
0	and
0	the
0	aged
0	priest
0	at
0	Parantounka
0	attending
0	.

0	Their
0	dress
0	,
0	upon
0	the
0	whole
0	,
0	was
0	more
0	decent
0	than
0	that
0	of
0	the
0	men
0	;

0	They
0	were
0	no
0	otherwise
0	clothed
0	than
0	decency
0	required
0	;

0	But
0	often
0	you
0	are
0	deceived
0	by
0	the
0	situation
0	of
0	the
0	sky
0	and
0	clouds
0	.

0	We
0	found
0	ourselves
0	debarred
0	from
0	the
0	thing
0	we
0	were
0	most
0	in
0	want
0	of
0	for
0	several
0	days
0	,
0	by
0	shoals
0	and
0	rocks
0	that
0	to
0	us
0	were
0	impracticable
0	.

0	Some
0	of
0	the
0	women
0	however
0	remained
0	on
0	board
0	,
0	who
0	never
0	could
0	be
0	prevailed
0	on
0	to
0	shew
0	themselves
0	upon
0	deck
0	in
0	the
0	day-time
0	;

0	The
0	use
0	they
0	made
0	of
0	these
0	was
0	,
0	probably
0	,
0	to
0	kill
0	small
0	animals
0	,
0	without
0	damaging
0	their
0	skins
0	.

0	The
0	dogs
0	of
0	this
0	country
0	are
0	like
0	our
0	village
0	curs
0	,
0	and
0	are
0	of
0	different
0	colours
0	.

0	We
0	also
0	,
0	by
0	the
0	assistance
0	of
PERSON-B	Mr.
PERSON-I	Nelson
0	,
0	whose
0	business
0	,
0	as
0	has
0	already
0	been
0	observed
0	,
0	was
0	to
0	collect
0	the
0	vegetable
0	and
0	other
0	curious
0	productions
0	of
0	the
0	countries
0	through
0	which
0	we
0	passed
0	,
0	were
0	enabled
0	to
0	stock
0	ourselves
0	with
0	a
0	large
0	proportion
0	of
0	culinary
0	plants
0	,
0	which
0	was
0	of
0	infinite
0	service
0	to
0	us
0	in
0	our
0	more
0	northerly
0	progress
0	.

0	The
0	grass
0	was
0	in
0	many
0	places
0	as
0	high
0	as
0	our
0	knees
0	,
0	and
0	the
0	corn
0	,
0	where
0	any
0	grew
0	,
0	bore
0	the
0	promising
0	appearance
0	of
0	a
0	fine
0	crop
0	.

0	but
0	not
0	being
0	able
0	to
0	make
0	out
0	any
0	thing
0	criminal
0	against
0	them
0	,
0	they
0	were
0	suffered
0	to
0	depart
0	.

0	In
0	several
0	places
0	,
0	fragments
0	of
0	white
0	and
0	very
0	transparent
0	quartz
0	,
0	sometimes
0	tinged
0	red
0	in
0	the
0	cracks
0	,
0	are
0	found
0	scattered
0	:
0	these
0	stones
0	the
0	natives
0	contrive
0	to
0	break
0	in
0	such
0	a
0	manner
0	,
0	that
0	a
0	sharp
0	edge
0	is
0	produced
0	,
0	and
0	use
0	them
0	to
0	cut
0	their
0	hair
0	.

0	We
0	then
0	got
0	under
0	way
0	,
0	standing
0	all
0	night
0	N.
0	one
0	half
0	W.
0	passing
0	in
0	the
0	night
0	several
0	large
0	sea
0	cows
0	and
0	other
0	sea
0	monsters
0	.

0	In
0	the
0	year
0	,
0	1773
0	on
0	the
0	26th
0	,
0	of
0	December
0	,
0	we
0	counted
0	186
0	masses
0	of
0	ice
0	all
0	in
0	sight
0	from
0	the
0	mast
0	head
0	,
0	whereof
0	none
0	was
0	less
0	than
0	the
0	hull
0	of
0	a
0	ship
0	.

0	in
0	the
0	neck
0	part
0	was
0	a
0	hole
0	,
0	through
0	which
0	they
0	passed
0	a
0	strong
0	cord
0	,
0	and
0	fastened
0	it
0	to
0	the
0	right
0	arm
0	;

0	The
0	rocks
0	along
0	the
0	sea-shore
0	,
0	are
0	formed
0	of
0	corals
0	and
0	madrepores
0	;

0	Both
0	these
0	instances
0	seem
0	therefore
0	to
0	prove
0	,
0	that
0	the
0	ice-masses
0	contribute
0	considerably
0	towards
0	cooling
0	the
0	atmosphere
0	.

0	From
0	this
0	table
0	it
0	appears
0	,
0	that
0	under
0	the
PLACE-B	Line
0	,
0	and
0	near
0	the
0	Tropics
0	,
0	the
0	water
0	is
0	cooler
0	at
0	a
0	great
0	depth
0	than
0	at
0	its
0	surface
0	.

0	but
0	by
0	what
0	conveyance
0	carried
0	on
0	,
0	all
0	our
0	endeavours
0	at
0	this
0	time
0	could
0	not
0	discover
0	.

0	The
0	mountain
0	in
0	the
0	middle
0	of
0	the
0	great
0	peninsula
0	of
PLACE-B	O-Taheitee
0	or
0	of
0	Tobreonoo
0	,
0	is
0	as
0	far
0	as
0	I
0	can
0	form
0	any
0	idea
0	,
0	the
0	highest
0	of
0	all
0	the
0	mountains
0	in
0	the
0	Tropical
0	Isles
0	:
0	it
0	is
0	in
0	some
0	places
0	of
0	an
0	easy
0	and
0	gentle
0	slope
0	,
0	and
0	intersected
0	by
0	numerous
0	and
0	very
0	deep
0	valleys
0	,
0	converging
0	towards
0	the
0	middle
0	of
0	the
0	isle
0	,
0	where
0	its
0	summits
0	are
0	to
0	be
0	met
0	with
0	.

0	but
0	by
0	contriving
0	several
0	additional
0	purchases
0	we
0	at
0	last
0	succeeded
0	,
0	with
0	the
0	misfortune
0	,
0	however
0	,
0	of
0	having
0	two
0	of
0	our
0	ablest
0	hands
0	wounded
0	;

0	and
0	,
0	as
0	the
0	contact
0	of
0	the
0	deck
0	and
0	warmer
0	atmosphere
0	contributes
0	to
0	dissolve
0	some
0	part
0	of
0	the
0	ice
0	,
0	the
0	rest
0	becomes
0	quite
0	fresh
0	.

0	And
0	the
0	reason
0	of
0	this
0	phaenomenon
0	is
0	obvious
0	,
0	after
0	considering
0	the
0	constitution
0	of
0	the
0	earth
0	in
0	those
0	high
0	Northern
0	climates
0	.

0	though
0	it
0	can
0	scarce
0	be
0	imagined
0	,
0	that
0	,
0	as
0	the
0	globe
0	is
0	now
0	constituted
0	,
0	they
0	could
0	ever
0	have
0	any

0	,
0	being
0	at
0	more
0	than
0	2000

0	/

0	miles
0	distance
0	one
0	from

0	,
0	with
0	very
0	little
0	,
0	if
0	any
0	,
0	dry
0	land
0	between
0	.

0	The
PERSON-B	King
0	very
0	readily
0	gave
0	his
0	consent
0	;

0	These
0	observations
0	on
0	the
0	difference
0	of
0	the
0	line
0	of
0	eternal
0	snow
0	,
0	give
0	us
0	an
0	opportunity
0	of
0	communicating
0	some
0	hints
0	or
0	conjectures
0	on
0	the
0	causes
0	of
0	this
0	difference
0	.

0	Among
0	the
0	fishing
0	implements
0	of
0	these
0	islanders
0	,
0	we
0	found
0	conic
0	pieces
0	of
0	calcareous
0	stone
0	;

0	If
0	we
0	now
0	add
0	to
0	this
0	,
0	that
0	beyond
0	the
0	71
0	°
0	South
0	,
0	the
0	temperature
0	of
0	the
0	air
0	and
0	ocean
0	must
0	be
0	still
0	colder
0	,
0	and
0	that
0	the
0	rigours
0	of
0	an
0	antarctic
0	winter
0	are
0	certainly
0	more
0	than
0	sufficient
0	to
0	cool
0	the
0	ocean
0	to
0	28
0	°
0	,
0	which
0	is
0	requisite
0	for
0	congealing
0	the
0	aqueous
0	particles
0	in
0	it
0	;

0	In
0	this
0	manner
0	,
0	and
0	on
0	these
0	conditions
0	,
0	peace
0	was
0	to
0	be
0	restored
0	.

0	but
0	,
0	from
0	all
0	concurring
0	circumstances
0	,
0	it
0	was
0	highly
0	probably
0	,
0	that
0	we
0	had
0	been
0	at
0	no
0	great
0	distance
0	from
0	it
0	.

0	The
0	rest
0	of
0	the
0	lands
0	,
0	not
0	comprehended
0	under
0	those
0	now

0	Nay
0	,
0	if
0	we
0	continue
0	the
0	comparison
0	,
0	all
0	continents
0	have
0	a
0	great
0	sinuosity
0	on
0	the
0	West-side
0	towards
0	the
0	north
0	.

0	but
0	the
0	farther
0	we
0	ran
0	to
0	the
0	eastward
0	,
0	the
0	closer
0	the
0	ice
0	became
0	compacted
0	.

0	so
0	were
0	beads
0	,
0	buttons
0	,
0	looking-glasses
0	,
0	china-cups
0	,
0	and
0	in

0	,
0	any
0	of
0	our
0	European
0	commodities
0	.

0	As
0	soon
0	as
0	the
0	Lieutenant
0	had
0	executed
0	his
0	commission
0	,
0	and
0	delivered
0	up
0	the
0	stores
0	to
0	the
0	Commodore
0	,
0	he
0	took
0	his
0	leave
0	,
0	and
0	returned
0	to
PLACE-B	Bolcheritsk
0	;

0	But
0	we
0	must
0	now
0	take
0	leave
0	of
0	these
0	islands
0	,
0	tho
0	'
0	we
0	shall
0	have
0	occasion
0	to
0	mention
0	them
0	again
0	with
0	less
0	commendation
0	.

0	The
0	first
0	care
0	of
0	the
0	commanders
0	of
0	both
0	ships
0	was
0	to
0	provide
0	for
0	the
0	recovery
0	of
0	the
0	sick
0	,
0	and
0	the
0	repairs
0	of
0	the
0	ships
0	;

0	quos
0	colores
0	!

0	He
0	seemed
0	much
0	affected
0	when
0	he
0	was
0	shewn
0	his
0	coffin
0	,
0	and
0	was
0	told
0	it
0	was
0	his
0	particular
0	desire
0	to
0	be
0	buried
0	on
0	shore
0	.

0	On
0	the
0	few
0	cocoa-trees
0	upon
0	the
0	island
0	,
0	the
0	number
0	of
0	which
0	did
0	not
0	exceed
0	thirty
0	,
0	very
0	little
0	fruit
0	was
0	found
0	;

0	They
0	commonly
0	wear
0	two
0	coats
0	;

0	But
0	all
0	hands
0	being
0	instantly
0	ordered
0	under
0	arms
0	,
0	these
0	new
0	visitors
0	were
0	seen
0	to
0	clothe
0	themselves
0	as
0	before
0	,
0	and
0	to
0	make
0	towards
0	the
0	ships
0	.

0	At
0	last
0	they
0	thought
0	of
0	climbing
0	the
0	highest
0	tree
0	,
0	to
0	try
0	if
0	they
0	could
0	discover
0	any
0	hill
0	or
0	eminence
0	,
0	from
0	whence
0	they
0	might
0	take
0	a
0	view
0	of
0	the
0	country
0	,
0	in
0	order
0	to
0	be
0	certain
0	whether
0	it
0	was
0	inhabited
0	or
0	not
0	.

0	those
0	in
0	the
0	towns
0	which
0	we
0	saw
0	,
0	had
0	learnt
0	of
0	the
0	Russians
0	to
0	be
0	more
0	cleanly
0	.

0	On
0	the
0	11th
0	,
0	we
0	were
0	alarmed
0	by
0	the
0	clashing
0	of
0	the
0	waves
0	,
0	as
0	if
0	some
0	great
0	building
0	was
0	tumbling
0	in
0	,
0	and
0	looking
0	round
0	the
0	ship
0	,
0	we
0	saw
0	ourselves
0	involved
0	among
0	shoals
0	of
0	seals
0	and
0	sea-lions
0	,
0	who
0	presently
0	set
0	up
0	the
0	most
0	frightful
0	howlings
0	;

0	Being
0	now
0	safely
0	moored
0	,
0	the
0	first
0	thing
0	that
0	claimed
0	the
0	attention
0	of
0	the
0	Commodore
0	,
0	was
0	to
0	provide
0	as
0	well
0	as
0	he
0	could
0	for
0	the
0	safety
0	of
0	the
0	crews
0	in
0	their
0	return
0	home
0	.

0	However
0	,
0	they
0	behaved
0	civilly
0	,
0	and
0	it
0	being
0	near
0	night
0	they
0	took
0	their
0	leave
0	,
0	promising
0	to
0	visit
0	us
0	again
0	in

0	a

0	On

0	at

0	In
0	the

0	stood
0	all
0	night
0	W.
0	by

0	66.35.
0	long
0	189.39
0	.

0	They
0	afterwards
0	asked
0	,
0	with
0	some
0	apparent
0	apprehension
0	,
0	when
PERSON-B	the
PERSON-I	Orono
0	would

0	what

0	?

0	On
0	the

0	at

0	E.
0	and
0	about

0	,
0	the

0	among

0	He
0	then

0	He
0	continued
0	on

0	some
0	hours
0	,
0	amusing
0	himself
0	with
0	seeing
0	the

0	;

0	Nothing
0	remarkable
0	till

0	the

0	,
0	1780
0	,
0	when

PERSON-B	King
0	,
0	with

0	Matters
0	being
0	thus

0	settled
0	,
0	no

0	on

0	to

0	on

0	.

0	but
0	what
0	made
0	us
0	amends
0	,
0	was
0	the

0	they
0	gave
0	for

0	,
0	on
0	which
0	they
0	set
0	a

0	.

0	but
0	even
0	this
0	is
0	subject
0	to
0	many
0	exceptions
0	:
0	sometimes
0	we
0	find
0	places
0	which
0	are
0	amazingly
0	clear
0	,
0	and
0	the

0	,
0	at
0	the

0	of
0	several

0	,
0	may
0	be
0	seen
0	as
0	plainly
0	as
0	if
0	it
0	were
0	within
0	a
0	few

0	of

0	;

0	The
0	first
0	species
0	of
0	luminous
0	appearance
0	seems
0	to
0	be
0	produced
0	by
0	a
0	cause
0	altogether
0	different
0	from
0	the
0	rest
0	,
0	and
0	if
0	I
0	may
0	venture
0	to
0	declare
0	my
0	opinion
0	on
0	the
0	subject
0	,
0	I
0	should
0	think
0	,
0	that
0	this
0	light
0	is
0	owing
0	to
0	electricity
0	.

0	On
0	the

0	we
0	continued
0	along-shore

0	½

0	sounding
0	from

0	to

0	fathom
0	.

0	and
0	coasting
0	it
0	along
0	,
0	they
0	discovered
0	the
0	skeleton
0	of
0	a
0	creature
0	that
0	,
0	by
0	its
0	length
0	,
0	appeared
0	to
0	be
0	an
0	allegator
0	.

0	At
0	twelve
0	o
0	'clock
0	we
0	hauled
0	our
0	wind
0	to
0	the

0	and
0	,
0	by
0	the
0	alertness
0	of
0	our
0	seamen
0	,
0	we
0	passed
0	them
0	with
0	very

0	.

0	At

0	,
0	by

0	those
0	,
0	therefore
0	,
0	of
0	the

0	would
0	naturally
0	be
0	led
0	to
0	call
0	the

0	of
0	the

0	to
0	their

0	it
0	is

0	,
0	in

0	,
0	evident

0	Their

0	The

0	On

PERSON-B	Capt.

0	.

0	The

0	like
PERSON-B	the

0	On

0	On

0	In

0	that

0	Several

0	one
0	came

0	,
0	to
0	whom
PERSON-B	Capt.
PERSON-I	Cook
0	gave
0	a

0	Some

0	According

0	it

0	However
0	,
0	by

0	it

0	.

0	and
0	it

0	Having
0	cleared
0	the

0	,
0	we
0	shaped
0	our

0	to

0	,
0	and
0	so
0	continued
0	till

0	when
0	,
0	seeing

0	and
0	that

0	which

0	We

0	approached

0	This

0	we
0	remained
0	several

0	For

0	within
0	which
0	,
0	from
0	several
0	indications
0	,
0	it
0	should
0	seem
0	that
0	a
0	considerable
0	river
0	runs
0	into
0	the
0	sea
0	.

0	this
0	we
0	saw
0	none
0	of
0	the
0	warriors
0	without
0	;

0	In
0	the
0	night
0	we
0	observed
0	they
0	made
0	large
0	fires
0	;

0	In
0	the
0	low
0	ground
0	,
0	lying
0	between
0	the
0	high
0	land
0	and
0	the
0	sea
0	,
0	was
0	a
0	lake
0	,
0	extending
0	to
0	the
0	S.
0	E.
0	farther
0	than
0	we
0	could
0	see
0	.

0	On
0	the
0	11th
0	we
0	found
0	ourselves
0	surrounded
0	with
0	ice
0	.

0	On
0	the
0	25th
0	we
0	passed
0	several
0	fields
0	of
0	ice
0	.

0	when
0	the
0	weather
0	clearing
0	up
0	,
0	we
0	saw
0	a
0	passage
0	or
0	streight
0	,
0	to
0	which
0	we
0	bore
0	away
0	,
0	and
0	found
0	the
0	two
0	continents
0	at
0	seven
0	o
0	'clock
0	on
0	each
0	side
0	of
0	us
0	.

0	being
0	quite
0	worn
0	down
0	with
0	fatigue
0	,
0	they
0	were
0	forced
0	to
0	give
0	over
0	,
0	and
0	men
0	from
0	the
0	Discovery
0	were
0	ordered
0	to
0	supply
0	their
0	places
0	.

0	at
0	first
0	there
0	were
0	some
0	thousand
0	spectators
0	;

0	Lat
0	.

0	but
0	by
0	every
0	appearance
0	were
0	at
0	no
0	great
0	distance
0	from
0	land
0	.

0	behind
0	them
0	appeared
0	large
0	flat
0	and
0	solid
0	masses
0	,
0	of
0	an
0	immense
0	extent
0	.

0	were
0	likewise
0	collected
0	on
0	the
0	shingly
0	beaches
0	of
0	this
0	isle
0	:
0	but
0	whether
0	they
0	were
0	thrown
0	up
0	by
0	a
0	volcano
0	in
0	the
0	neighbourhood
0	,
0	or
0	carried
0	there
0	from
0	remote
0	parts
0	by
0	the
0	sea
0	,
0	I
0	cannot
0	determine
0	.

0	The
0	men
0	almost
0	exhausted
0	with
0	fatigue
0	;

0	The
0	small
0	rivers
0	,
0	which
0	are
0	formed
0	in
0	high
0	latitudes
0	,
0	have
0	,
0	properly
0	speaking
0	,
0	no
0	sources
0	,
0	no
0	springs
0	,
0	but
0	carry
0	off
0	only
0	the
0	waters
0	generated
0	by
0	the
0	melting
0	of
0	snow
0	in
0	spring
0	,
0	and
0	by
0	the
0	fall
0	of
0	rain
0	in
0	the
0	short
0	summer
0	,
0	and
0	are
0	for
0	the
0	greatest
0	part
0	dry
0	in
0	autumn
0	.

0	Perhaps
0	these
0	dogs
0	,
0	being
0	numerous
0	,
0	may
0	constitute
0	a
0	part
0	of
0	their
0	food
0	;

0	it
0	must
0	therefore
0	continually
0	melt
0	and
0	decay
0	;

0	On
0	the
0	29th
0	,
0	we
0	stood
0	in
0	for
0	the
0	land
0	,
0	and
0	at
0	two
0	in
0	the
0	afternoon
0	,
0	we
0	came
0	in
0	sight
0	of
0	the
0	entrance
0	of
0	the
0	bay
0	of
PLACE-B	Kamshatska
0	,
0	then
0	distant
0	between

0	to
0	the
0	Southward
0	.

0	no
0	inhabitants
0	for
0	many
0	miles
0	,
0	and
0	the
0	cold
0	excessive
0	as
0	they
0	approached
0	the
0	mountain
0	,
0	which
0	seemed
0	covered
0	with
0	snow
0	,
0	they
0	were
0	glad
0	to
0	get
0	back
0	without
0	any
0	accident
0	.

0	Their
0	clothes
0	,
0	for
0	the
0	most
0	part
0	,
0	are
0	made
0	of
0	the
0	skins
0	of
0	land
0	and
0	sea-animals
0	,
0	particularly
0	deer
0	,
0	dogs
0	,
0	and
0	seals
0	;

0	At
0	two
0	in
0	the
0	afternoon
0	,
0	both
0	ships
0	stood
0	S.
0	by
0	W.
0	with
0	a
0	stiff
0	breeze
0	.

0	At
0	this
0	time
0	came
0	in
0	sight
0	of
0	a
0	narrow
0	channel
0	that
0	seemed
0	to
0	lead
0	to
0	the
0	lake
0	,
0	which
0	we
0	had
0	seen
0	the
0	day
0	before
0	.

0	The
0	shape
0	of
0	these
0	illuminated
0	bodies
0	discovered
0	them
0	to
0	be
0	fishes
0	.

0	but
0	it
0	was
0	not
0	till
0	The
0	23d
0	that
0	we
0	discovered
0	land
0	.

0	Lat
0	.

0	193
0	.

0	To
0	our
0	iron
0	hatchets
0	they
0	gave
0	the
0	first
0	name
0	.

0	the
0	winter
0	drawing
0	on
0	apace
0	;

0	As
0	we
0	staid
0	but
0	a
0	few
0	days
0	here
0	,
0	we
0	had
0	not
0	much
0	time
0	to
0	examine
0	the
0	higher
0	parts
0	of
0	the
0	isle
0	.

0	We
0	exchanged
0	some
0	trifles
0	,
0	and
0	soon
0	parted
0	.

0	the
0	other
0	belonged
0	to
0	the
0	Russians
0	.

0	On
0	the
0	18th
0	we
0	stood
0	the
0	whole
0	day
0	W.
0	S.
0	W.
0	with
0	a
0	stiff
0	breeze
0	.

0	but
0	the
0	gale
0	continuing
0	,
0	could
0	not
0	come
0	near
0	enough
0	to
0	〈
0	…
0	〉
0	.

0	So
0	,
0	however
0	it
0	happened
0	.

0	On
0	the
0	12th
0	,
0	light
0	winds
0	,
0	which
0	continued
0	all
0	the
0	morning
0	with
0	snow
0	and
0	sleet
0	.

0	she
0	became
0	leaky
0	on
0	the
0	7th
0	,
0	when
0	it
0	blew
0	a
0	tempest
0	.

0	This
0	necessarily
0	retarded
0	our
0	departure
0	;

0	but
0	what
0	was
0	remarkable
0	,
0	none
0	of
0	the
0	inhabitants
0	,
0	whom
0	we
0	had
0	visited
0	,
0	offered
0	to
0	approach
0	us
0	,
0	though
0	the
0	weather
0	was
0	favourable
0	.

0	and
0	all
0	other
0	business
0	was
0	suspended
0	till
0	that
0	was
0	repaired
0	.

0	On
0	the
0	9th
0	,
0	we
0	stood
0	the
0	whole
0	day
0	S.
0	W.
0	Lat
0	.

0	that
0	its
0	saltness
0	increases
0	with
0	its
0	large
0	depth
0	;

0	their
0	arrows
0	two
0	feet
0	,
0	pointed
0	with
0	bone
0	or
0	flint
0	,
0	some
0	few
0	with
0	iron
0	;

0	E.
0	On
0	the
0	10th
0	,
0	both
0	ships
0	stood
0	again
0	for
0	the
0	land
0	,
0	which
0	we
0	could
0	see
0	at
0	a
0	great
0	distance
0	.

0	We
0	were
0	in
0	readiness
0	to
0	give
0	them
0	a
0	warm
0	reception
0	;

0	Some
0	native
0	sulphur
0	was
0	to
0	be
0	seen
0	in
0	this
0	earth
0	,
0	together
0	with
0	several
0	green
0	specks
0	or
0	marks
0	of
0	copper
0	.

0	The
0	next
0	remark
0	is
0	,
0	that
0	salt
0	water
0	does
0	not
0	freeze
0	at
0	all
0	,
0	or
0	if
0	it
0	does
0	it
0	contains
0	briny
0	particles
0	.

0	He
0	came
0	from
0	the
0	Southward
0	,
0	accompanied
0	by
0	a
0	number
0	of
0	Indian
0	canoes
0	,
0	laden
0	with
0	skins
0	,
0	who
0	on
0	coming
0	ashore
0	in
0	the
0	harbour
0	,
0	instantly
0	began
0	erecting
0	a
0	tent
0	,
0	which
0	in
0	half
0	an
0	hour
0	they
0	finished
0	,
0	covering
0	it
0	with
0	skins
0	.

0	We
0	made
0	him
0	understand
0	that
0	we
0	wanted
0	provisions
0	;

0	1
0	,
0	we
0	continued
0	coasting
0	to
0	the
0	eastward
0	,
0	as
0	the
0	land
0	trended
0	;

0	saw
0	no
0	inhabitants
0	,
0	but
0	very
0	large
0	trees
0	,
0	and
0	bleak
0	mountains
0	covered
0	with
0	snow
0	.

0	On
0	the
0	15th
0	,
0	wore
0	ship
0	,
0	and
0	stood
0	N.
0	half
0	W.
0	the
0	wind
0	E.
0	N.
0	E.
0	all
0	the
0	morning
0	.

0	Course
0	as
0	before
0	.

0	and
0	that
0	it
0	was
0	with
0	difficulty
0	they
0	could
0	keep
0	her
0	above
0	water
0	.

0	At
0	ten
0	at
0	night
0	we
0	saw
0	a
0	great
0	number
0	of
0	ducks
0	,
0	geese
0	,
0	and
0	sea-parrots
0	very
0	near
0	us
0	,
0	by
0	which
0	we
0	judged
0	land
0	could
0	not
0	be
0	far
0	off
0	.

0	He
0	landed
0	on
0	an
0	island
0	,
0	that
0	,
0	it
0	should
0	seem
0	,
0	divided
0	this
0	main
0	channel
0	,
0	and
0	a
0	branch
0	that
0	had
0	an
0	easterly
0	course
0	,
0	upon
0	which
0	he
0	found
0	current
0	bushes
0	,
0	with
0	the
0	fruit
0	already
0	(
0	June
0	)
0	set
0	;

0	Who
0	sent
0	them
0	,
0	or
0	for
0	what
0	purpose
0	,
0	we
0	never
0	could
0	learn
0	.

0	but
0	looking
0	over
0	the
0	ship
0	's
0	side
0	,
0	observed
0	the
0	water
0	to
0	change
0	to
0	a
0	milky
0	white
0	.

0	The
0	people
0	are
0	civil
0	,
0	and
0	in
0	their
0	way
0	very
0	obliging
0	;

0	He
0	could
0	not
0	be
0	prevailed
0	upon
0	to
0	go
0	below
0	;

0	We
0	saw
0	but
0	few
0	of
0	them
0	during
0	our
0	stay
0	,
0	and
0	those
0	who
0	came
0	in
0	sight
0	were
0	rather
0	in
0	years
0	;

0	Lat
0	.

0	In
0	the
0	morning
0	of
0	the
0	22d
0	we
0	tacked
0	,
0	and
0	stood
0	to
0	the
0	westward
0	,
0	and
0	still
0	saw
0	the
0	land
0	trend
0	very
0	much
0	to
0	the
0	southward
0	.

0	In
0	the
0	night
0	,
0	we
0	saw
0	several
0	fires
0	,
0	but
0	no
0	Indians
0	came
0	off
0	to
0	us
0	.

0	but
0	it
0	was
0	not
0	till
0	the
0	11th
0	,
0	when
0	we
0	opened
0	on
0	the
0	bay
0	in
0	which
0	lay
0	our
0	port
0	.

0	Nothing
0	remarkable
0	till
0	The
0	25th
0	of
0	March
0	,
0	when
0	we
0	were
0	attacked
0	by
0	a
0	severe
0	storm
0	,
0	attended
0	with
0	thunder
0	,
0	lightning
0	and
0	rain
0	,
0	which
0	lasted
0	five
0	days
0	without
0	intermission
0	.

0	The
0	same
0	question
0	had
0	been
0	asked
0	by
0	others
0	,
0	which
0	shews
0	,
0	the
0	opinion
0	they
0	entertain
0	of
0	the
0	spirit
0	's
0	power
0	after
0	it
0	is
0	separated
0	from
0	the
0	body
0	.

0	All
0	this
0	day
0	we
0	kept
0	our
0	course
0	S.
0	W.
0	by
0	S.
0	On
0	the
0	23d
0	,
0	in
0	the
0	evening
0	,
0	we
0	shaped
0	our
0	course
0	more
0	to
0	the
0	Westward
0	,
0	the
0	weather
0	thick
0	and
0	hazy
0	.

0	Or
0	,
0	in
0	the
0	second
0	case
0	,
0	if
0	the
0	ice
0	be
0	formed
0	far
0	from
0	any
0	land
0	,
0	this
0	climate
0	must
0	likewise
0	be
0	farther
0	to
0	the
0	South
0	than
0	our
0	tracks
0	,
0	as
0	we
0	never
0	fell
0	in
0	with
0	ice
0	,
0	which
0	we
0	would
0	with
0	certainty
0	consider
0	as
0	stationary
0	,
0	but
0	,
0	on
0	the
0	contrary
0	,
0	found
0	it
0	commonly
0	in
0	motion
0	.

0	we
0	shortened
0	sail
0	,
0	and
0	stood
0	to
0	the
0	southward
0	.

0	and
0	this
0	was
0	the
0	appearance
0	,
0	when
0	we
0	entered
0	the
0	loose
0	ice
0	on
0	January
0	the
0	17th
0	,
0	1773
0	,
0	in
0	67
0	°
0	15
0	'
0	South
0	latitude
0	;

0	We
0	were
0	now
0	in
0	the
0	utmost
0	distress
0	;

0	whereas
0	the
0	others
0	are
0	suddenly
0	steep
0	.

0	223
0	.

0	Being
0	in
0	great
0	want
0	of
0	masts
0	,
0	most
0	of
0	those
0	we
0	brought
0	out
0	with
0	us
0	being
0	sprung
0	,
0	our
0	carpenters
0	were
0	sent
0	into
0	the
0	woods
0	to
0	cut
0	down
0	such
0	trees
0	as
0	they
0	should
0	find
0	fit
0	for
0	their
0	purpose
0	.

0	we
0	had
0	likewise
0	got
0	a
0	considerable
0	quantity
0	of
0	wood
0	from
0	the
0	shore
0	.

0	On
0	the
0	27th
0	,
0	the
0	gale
0	still
0	continuing
0	,
0	to
0	add
0	to
0	our
0	labour
0	,
0	we
0	sprung
0	a
0	leak
0	,
0	which
0	kept
0	us
0	to
0	the
0	pumps
0	till
0	the
0	storm
0	abated
0	.

0	While
0	we
0	remained
0	in
0	our
0	boats
0	,
0	several
0	other
0	Chiefs
0	came
0	to
0	the
0	water-side
0	;

0	We
0	instantly
0	wore
0	ship
0	,
0	and
0	stood
0	in
0	for
0	a
0	fine
0	bay
0	,
0	on
0	which
0	we
0	found
0	good
0	anchorage
0	in
0	48
0	fathom
0	water
0	.

0	however
0	she
0	left
0	us
0	,
0	and
0	made
0	for
0	the
0	Resolution
0	.

0	but
0	after
0	staying
0	some
0	time
0	in
0	the
0	ship
0	,
0	he
0	was
0	carried
0	again
0	to
0	his
0	canoe
0	,
0	and
0	returned
0	to
0	the
0	island
0	.

0	She
0	was
0	bound
0	to
0	the
0	Southward
0	,
0	and
0	we
0	pursued
0	our
0	course
0	.

0	But
0	about
0	six
0	in
0	the
0	evening
0	the
0	wind
0	freshened
0	,
0	and
0	before
0	we
0	could
0	hand
0	the
0	canvas
0	,
0	split
0	the
0	fore-top-sail
0	.

0	and
0	this
0	happens
0	commonly
0	in
0	a
0	fresh
0	gale
0	.

0	ALL
0	the
0	islands
0	which
0	we
0	saw
0	during

0	are
0	either

0	On
0	the
0	26th
0	,
0	the
0	Resolution
0	made
0	the
0	signal
0	of

0	We
0	now
0	gave

0	Lat

0	This
0	island
0	,
0	on

0	,
0	was
0	found
0	barren
0	,
0	and
0	destitute
0	of

0	.

0	the
0	gale
0	continuing

0	The
0	22d

0	On

0	we

0	by

0	About

0	we

0	which

0	Him

0	We
0	were
0	now

0	skin
0	,
0	which

0	makes
0	the

0	appear
0	like
0	one

0	and
0	before
0	noon
0	she
0	came
0	in

0	,
0	seemingly
0	in

0	all
0	seemed

0	a

0	On

0	we
0	had
0	thunder

0	We
0	kept
0	steering
0	to
0	the

0	,
0	as
0	we
0	saw
0	no
0	land

0	by

0	of
0	a
0	great
0	fog
0	;

0	Lat
0	.

0	and
0	I
0	must
0	confess
0	,
0	I
0	saw
0	only
0	a
0	few
0	habitations
0	on
0	its
0	South
0	side
0	near
0	the

0	Another

0	On

0	been
0	against

0	Lat
0	.

0	Early
0	in
0	the
0	morning
0	of
0	the
0	27th
0	we
0	saw
0	2
0	sail

0	seemingly
0	very
0	large
0	,
0	making
0	towards
0	us
0	from

0	but
0	we
0	were
0	the
0	whole
0	afternoon
0	in
0	working
0	up
0	the
0	Race
0	,
0	as
0	it
0	was
0	called
0	,
0	from

0	motion
0	,
0	and
0	the
0	strength
0	with
0	which
0	it
0	set
0	against
0	us
0	.

0	We
0	were
0	then
0	in

0	We
0	were
0	now
0	by
0	observation
0	in

0	and
0	then
0	they
0	came
0	on

0	Sounded
0	all
0	day

0	In

0	They

0	On
0	the

0	about

0	P.

0	we
0	came
0	in

0	and

0	It

0	our

0	on

0	Course

0	on

0	three

0	in
0	the

0	Their
0	number
0	was
0	alarming

0	We

0	obliged

0	change
0	our

0	our

0	and
0	every

0	On

0	The

0	And
0	On

0	In

0	On

0	About

0	At

0	We

0	The

0	The

0	which
0	the

0	About

0	E.
0	At

0	us
0	,
0	and
0	about

0	,
0	being
0	within
0	half
0	a

0	we

0	in
0	which
0	were
0	six

0	At

0	On
0	the

0	,
0	there
0	came
0	two

0	from
0	the
0	shore
0	,
0	with
0	four
0	Indians
0	in
0	them
0	,

0	we
0	were
0	distant
0	full
0	four

0	The
0	26th
0	we
0	again
0	bore
0	away
0	W.
0	S.
0	W.
0	and
0	so
0	continued
0	all

0	.

0	every

0	was
0	to

0	understood
0	by
0	signs
0	.

0	Before
0	night
0	we
0	were
0	in
0	lat
0	.

0	With
0	this
0	ice
0	the
0	boiler

0	filled
0	,

0	it

0	the
0	more

0	be
0	dissolved
0	.

0	Here
0	a
0	man
0	in
0	a
0	small
0	canoe
0	came
0	on
0	board
0	the
0	Resolution
0	.

0	but
0	before
0	we
0	reached
0	the
0	shore
0	,
0	a
0	sudden
0	storm
0	came
0	on
0	,
0	more
0	violent
0	than
0	any
0	we
0	had
0	yet
0	met
0	with
0	on
0	this
0	tempestuous
0	coast
0	.

0	and
0	at
0	the
0	distance
0	of
0	about
0	twenty
0	miles
0	the
0	volcano
0	,
0	from
0	whence
0	flames
0	and
0	ashes
0	are
0	sometimes
0	emitted
0	;

0	From
0	the
0	time
0	of
0	attempting
0	to
0	get
0	round
0	the
0	island
0	,
0	till
0	the
0	8th
0	of
0	January
0	,
0	we
0	had
0	never
0	been
0	able
0	to
0	get
0	sight
0	of
0	her
0	,
0	though
0	both
0	ships
0	were
0	constantly
0	looking
0	out
0	to
0	find
0	each
0	other
0	.

0	As
0	they
0	grew
0	tired
0	of
0	their
0	diversion
0	,
0	they
0	repaired
0	to
0	the
0	place
0	of
0	rendezvous
0	;

0	but
0	we
0	afterwards
0	found
0	that
0	it
0	was
0	part
0	of
0	their
0	ceremony
0	in
0	burying
0	their
0	dead
0	.

0	But
0	it
0	is
0	likewise
0	certain
0	,
0	that
0	there
0	is
0	more
0	than
0	one
0	way
0	,
0	by
0	which
0	those
0	immense
0	ice
0	masses
0	are
0	formed
0	.

0	By
0	this
0	time
0	dinner
0	was
0	ready
0	,
0	and
0	the
0	gentlemen
0	were
0	invited
0	to
0	partake
0	of
0	what
0	had
0	been
0	provided
0	;

0	and
0	at
0	noon
0	,
0	the
0	signal
0	was
0	made
0	to
0	weigh
0	;

0	but
0	in
0	the
0	bay
0	itself
0	we
0	had
0	no
0	ground
0	with
0	80
0	fathom
0	line
0	.

0	We
0	stood
0	N.
0	by
0	E.
0	the
0	wind
0	shifted
0	to
0	E.
0	by
0	N.
0	and
0	a
0	calm
0	succeeded
0	.

0	They
0	were
0	invited
0	on
0	board
0	,
0	but
0	could
0	not
0	be
0	persuaded
0	to
0	enter
0	.

0	We
0	then
0	made
0	sail
0	N.
0	N.
0	W.
0	which
0	course
0	we
0	continued
0	all
0	night
0	.

0	and
0	in
0	the
0	mean
0	time
0	,
0	while
0	she
0	was
0	beating
0	up
0	,
0	we
0	were
0	employed
0	in
0	compleating
0	our
0	hold
0	.

0	The
0	man
0	paddled
0	off
0	;

0	We
0	fired
0	several
0	muskets
0	among
0	them
0	,
0	which
0	sent
0	them
0	to
0	the
0	water
0	with
0	dreadful
0	yellings
0	.

0	but
0	in
0	that
0	little
0	time
0	the
0	sea
0	broke
0	over
0	our
0	quarter
0	,
0	and
0	cleared
0	the
0	decks
0	of
0	every
0	thing
0	that
0	was
0	loose
0	.

0	every
0	unprejudiced
0	reader
0	will
0	find
0	it
0	necessary
0	to
0	allow
0	the
0	temperature
0	of
0	the
0	Southern
0	hemisphere
0	,
0	to
0	be
0	remarkably
0	colder
0	than
0	that
0	of
0	the
0	Northern
0	;

0	On
0	the
0	28th
0	we
0	saw
0	land
0	bearing
0	W.
0	N.
0	W.
0	to
0	S.
0	half
0	W.
0	distant
0	about
0	six
0	leagues
0	.

0	On
0	the
0	26th
0	,
0	being
0	then
0	in

0	.

0	Lat
0	.

0	Tierra
0	Del
0	Fuego
0	is
0	richly
0	provided
0	with
0	the
0	finest
0	springs
0	and
0	large
0	ponds
0	of
0	fresh
0	water
0	,
0	from
0	the
0	melted
0	snow
0	,
0	on
0	its
0	high
0	and
0	barren
0	rocks
0	.

0	and
0	even
0	fairer
0	than
0	many
0	of
0	the
0	men
0	we
0	had
0	on
0	board
0	.

0	Lat.
0	at
0	noon
0	,
0	20
0	.

0	We
0	shortened
0	sail
0	,
0	and
0	waited
0	for
0	her
0	coming
0	up
0	.

0	To
0	get
0	a
0	nearer
0	view
0	of
0	the
0	eastern
0	branch
0	,
0	the
0	Resolution
0	weighed
0	,
0	and
0	plyed
0	up
0	before
0	high
0	water
0	;

0	happy
0	that
0	day-light
0	had
0	enabled
0	us
0	to
0	escape
0	the
0	danger
0	.

0	He
0	further
0	said
0	,
0	that
0	on
0	the
0	7th
0	in
0	the
0	morning
0	they
0	discovered
0	the
0	leak
0	;

0	and
0	in
0	the
0	morning
0	,
0	when
0	the
0	gentlemen
0	rose
0	,
0	they
0	found
0	their
0	wishes
0	anticipated
0	by
0	an
0	order
0	lying
0	on
0	their
0	table
0	,
0	ready
0	to
0	be
0	forwarded
0	to
0	the
0	subaltern
0	at
0	the
0	fort
0	,
0	to
0	supply
0	the
0	ships
0	with
0	the
0	articles
0	they
0	most
0	wanted
0	,
0	without
0	regard
0	to
0	their
0	being
0	wanted
0	by
0	the
0	garrison
0	.

0	We
0	were
0	driven
0	as
0	far
0	back
0	as
0	the
0	place
0	from
0	whence
0	we
0	set
0	out
0	.

0	Another
0	kind
0	of
0	phosphoreal
0	light
0	I
0	observed
0	commonly
0	in
0	,
0	or
0	immediately
0	succeeding
0	a
0	long
0	calm
0	,
0	after
0	hot

0	;

0	This
0	current
0	ran
0	with
0	such
0	force
0	,
0	that
0	the
0	Resolution
0	,
0	unable
0	to
0	stem
0	it
0	,
0	cast
0	anchor
0	,
0	and

0	Here
0	the

0	manned
0	,
0	and
0	all
0	the
0	gentlemen
0	went
0	on

0	.

0	We
0	continued
0	the

0	course
0	till

0	In

0	were
0	seen
0	to
0	come
0	from
0	the

0	E.
0	We
0	at

0	thought
0	they

0	had
0	traded
0	on

0	The

0	At

0	July
0	the

0	,
0	we
0	had
0	the
0	Discovery
0	's
0	people
0	on
0	board
0	,
0	to
0	compare
0	time
0	.

0	but
0	before
0	dark
0	it
0	again
0	began
0	to
0	blow
0	with
0	heavy
0	rain
0	.

0	&amp;
0	amp
0	;

0	We
0	shaped
0	our
0	course
0	S.
0	S.
0	W.
0	and
0	continued
0	the
0	same
0	the
0	whole
0	night
0	,
0	sounding
0	from
0	22
0	to
0	26
0	fathom
0	,
0	grey
0	sand
0	and
0	small
0	shells
0	.

0	These
0	had
0	orders
0	to
0	traverse
0	the

0	in
0	a

0	,
0	till
0	they

0	them
0	,
0	either
0	living
0	or
0	dead
0	;

0	and
0	at
0	first
0	behaved
0	with
0	great
0	civility
0	,
0	but
0	could
0	not
0	be
0	persuaded
0	to

0	We
0	now
0	and
0	then
0	even
0	out
0	of
0	sight
0	of
0	any
0	land
0	,
0	tried
0	to
0	measure
0	this

0	;

0	We
0	kept
0	off
0	and
0	on
0	all
0	night
0	.

0	that
0	it
0	was
0	every
0	winter
0	three
0	feet
0	deep
0	in
0	water
0	;

0	glass
0	bowls
0	was
0	a

0	that

0	with
0	the

0	they
0	kept

0	above

0	.

0	neither
0	did
0	a

0	canoe
0	come
0	near
0	us
0	all
0	the
0	next
0	day
0	.

0	They
0	had
0	traversed
0	the
0	thicket
0	as
0	long
0	as
0	they
0	were
0	able
0	,
0	in
0	search
0	of
0	the
0	gentlemen
0	without
0	success
0	;

0	as
0	we
0	neared
0	it
0	,
0	we
0	observed
0	several
0	smokes
0	far
0	up
0	the
0	country
0	;

0	There
0	are
0	in
0	it
0	three
0	excellent
0	harbours
0	.

0	When
0	the
0	corpse
0	arrived
0	at
0	the
0	grave
0	,
0	it
0	was
0	deposited
0	under
0	the
0	triple
0	discharge
0	of
0	the

0	;

0	Sept
0	.

0	but
0	after
0	having
0	been
0	buried
0	a
0	minute
0	,
0	it
0	rose
0	to
0	210
0	°
0	and
0	there
0	it
0	remained
0	stationary
0	for
0	five
0	minutes
0	.

0	At
0	four
0	,
0	P.
0	M.
0	the
0	land
0	opened
0	all
0	round
0	,
0	from
0	one
0	shore
0	to
0	the
0	other
0	;

0	On
0	the
0	19th
0	,
0	we
0	came
0	in
0	sight
0	of
0	the
0	Resolution
0	:
0	and
0	though
0	it
0	blew
0	hard
0	,
0	they
0	threw
0	out
0	the
0	signal
0	for
0	us
0	to
0	make
0	sail
0	,
0	from
0	whence
0	we
0	concluded
0	that
0	the
0	leak
0	still
0	distressed
0	them
0	.

0	Under
0	their
0	feet
0	they
0	had
0	a
0	coarse
0	covering
0	that
0	served
0	for
0	shoes
0	.

0	But
0	it
0	was
0	now
0	become
0	absolutely
0	necessary
0	,
0	either
0	to
0	perfect
0	the
0	discovery
0	,
0	or
0	relinquish
0	the
0	voyage
0	.

0	Lat
0	.

0	On
0	the
0	21st
0	we
0	stood
0	from
0	W.
0	½
0	N.
0	to
0	W.
0	N.
0	W.
0	and
0	at
0	six
0	o
0	'clock
0	we
0	passed
0	a
0	large
0	island
0	of
0	ice
0	,
0	on
0	which
0	were
0	whole
0	herds
0	of
0	sea-cows
0	of
0	an
0	enormous
0	size
0	.

0	And
0	happy
0	it
0	was
0	,
0	for
0	On
0	the
0	8th
0	,
0	we
0	had
0	a
0	violent
0	storm
0	of
0	hail
0	,
0	rain
0	and
0	snow
0	,
0	which
0	continued
0	all
0	the
0	morning
0	;

0	On
0	the
0	11th
0	,
0	she
0	answered
0	our
0	signals
0	,
0	and
0	we
0	were
0	soon
0	in
0	company
0	;

0	Early
0	on
0	the
0	first
0	of
0	May
0	,
0	we
0	weighed
0	,
0	having
0	the
0	Resolution
0	's
0	boat
0	to
0	direct
0	us
0	.

0	We
0	presently
0	weighed
0	,
0	and
0	pursued
0	our
0	course
0	with
0	a
0	fine
0	breeze
0	.

0	we
0	steered
0	N.

0	by

0	the

0	point
0	of

0	in

0	This
0	day
0	the
0	gentlemen
0	from
0	both
0	ships
0	diverted
0	themselves
0	in
0	shooting
0	.

0	others
0	shewed
0	themselves
0	with
0	the
0	spoils
0	taken
0	from
0	the
0	dead
0	;

0	distance
0	about

0	New-zeeland
0	no
0	doubt
0	has
0	abundance
0	of
0	springs
0	and
0	rivulets
0	;

0	and
0	it
0	was
0	next
0	to
0	a
0	miracle
0	that
0	none
0	were
0	killed
0	.

0	He
0	wore
0	a

0	of
0	green
0	cloth
0	breeches
0	,
0	and
0	a

0	of

0	.

0	and
0	that

0	would
0	embrace
0	the
0	first
0	opportunity
0	of
0	waiting
0	upon
0	the
0	Commodore
0	.

0	On
0	the

0	as
0	we
0	enter
0	is
0	the

0	,
0	of
0	which
0	mention
0	has
0	already
0	been
0	made
0	;

0	and
0	happy
0	it
0	was
0	we
0	used
0	that
0	precaution
0	;

0	In
0	vain
0	they
0	attempted
0	to
0	regain
0	the
0	shore
0	;

0	but
0	great
0	lights
0	and
0	fires
0	were
0	kept
0	burning
0	all
0	night
0	.

0	Here
0	,
0	from
0	a
0	healthy
0	ship
0	's
0	company
0	,
0	several
0	of
0	our
0	people
0	fell
0	ill
0	of
0	the
0	flux
0	,
0	and
0	so
0	continued
0	for
0	some
0	time
0	;

0	but
0	when
0	along-side
0	,
0	they
0	had
0	little
0	or
0	nothing
0	to
0	part
0	with
0	,
0	except
0	some
0	dried
0	fish
0	.

0	and
0	,
0	on
0	our
0	near
0	approach
0	,
0	〈
0	◊
0	〉
0	sail
0	did
0	the
0	same
0	.

0	there
0	must
0	therefore
0	exist
0	Austral
0	lands
0	;

0	We
0	hove
0	to
0	for
0	their
0	coming
0	up
0	;

0	for
0	one
0	kind
0	of
0	these
0	phaenomena
0	never
0	extend
0	to
0	a

0	distance
0	from
0	the
0	ship
0	;

0	About
0	four
0	in
0	the
0	afternoon
0	we
0	entered
0	the
0	mouth
0	of
0	the
0	strait
0	,
0	and
0	met
0	a
0	strong
0	current
0	that
0	set
0	to
0	the
0	southward
0	to
0	oppose
0	our
0	progress
0	;

0	He
0	made
0	signs
0	for
0	water
0	,
0	and
0	water
0	was
0	given
0	him
0	.

0	We
0	sounded
0	,
0	and
0	found
0	no
0	bottom
0	at
0	100
0	fathoms
0	.

0	and
0	were
0	in
0	possession
0	of
0	a
0	greater
0	variety
0	of
0	skins
0	than
0	those
0	within
0	land
0	,
0	which
0	were
0	strong
0	indications
0	of
0	a
0	foreign
0	trade
0	;

0	These
0	being
0	shipped
0	,
0	nothing
0	remained
0	to
0	be
0	done
0	,
0	but
0	to
0	take
0	on
0	board
0	the
0	live
0	stock
0	which
0	the
0	Commodore
0	and
0	officers
0	had
0	purchased
0	for
0	their

0	,
0	and
0	nine
0	head
0	of
0	cattle
0	to

0	killed
0	at

0	for
0	the

0	of
0	the
0	ship
0	's
0	company
0	;

0	To
0	this
0	they
0	readily
0	agreed
0	;

0	and
0	this
0	among
0	a
0	crowd
0	of
0	people
0	of
0	more
0	than

0	April
0	22
0	.

0	and
0	soon
0	after
0	it
0	broke
0	forth
0	in
0	thunder
0	,
0	lightning
0	,
0	wind
0	,
0	and
0	rain
0	,
0	which
0	in
0	two
0	hours
0	increased
0	to
0	such
0	a
0	violent
0	degree
0	,
0	as
0	no
0	man
0	on
0	board
0	had
0	ever
0	known
0	the
0	like
0	.

0	we
0	stood
0	in
0	for
0	land
0	;

0	and
0	the
0	〈
0	…
0	〉
0	passengers
0	went
0	on
0	shore
0	,
0	and
0	set
0	out
0	for
0	〈
0	…
0	〉
0	The
0	Captains
0	and
0	officers
0	went
0	likewise
0	on
0	shore
0	,
0	and
0	the
0	men
0	had
0	liberty
0	to
0	divert
0	themselves
0	by
0	turns
0	during
0	our
0	stay
0	.

0	and
0	had
0	taken
0	this
0	method
0	of
0	exposing
0	him
0	for
0	injuring
0	his
0	friend
0	.

0	On
0	the
0	29th
0	the
0	man
0	at
0	the
0	mast-head
0	called
0	out

0	very
0	high
0	,
0	distance
0	about
0	two

0	right
0	a-head
0	.

0	and
0	for
0	the
0	remainder
0	of
0	the
0	month
0	had
0	fine
0	weather
0	.

0	On
0	the
0	27th
0	we
0	stood
0	E.
0	one-half
0	N.
0	and
0	found
0	ourselves
0	by
0	observation
0	in
0	lat
0	.

0	but
0	the
0	state
0	of
0	the
0	provisions
0	on
0	board
0	the
0	Resolution
0	made
0	it
0	necessary
0	,
0	and
0	that
0	he
0	himself
0	should
0	set
0	the
0	example
0	.

0	nor
0	did
0	it
0	appear
0	that
0	they
0	had
0	ever
0	seen
0	an
0	European
0	ship
0	before
0	,
0	though
0	they
0	were
0	not
0	wholly
0	unacquainted
0	with
0	the
0	use
0	of
0	iron
0	.

0	At
0	night
0	we
0	shortened
0	sail
0	.

0	and
0	those
0	who
0	have
0	short
0	hair
0	,
0	supply
0	the
0	locks
0	with
0	false

0	and
0	last
0	of
0	all
0	,
0	New

0	Old
0	Greenland
0	.

0	and
0	the
0	boy
0	,
0	in
0	return
0	,
0	was
0	no

0	attached
0	to

0	.

0	Thus
0	fell
0	the

0	navigator
0	that
0	this
0	or
0	any

0	On

0	the

0	We

0	but
0	what
0	was
0	astonishing
0	,
0	it
0	had
0	now
0	stopt
0	of

0	,
0	without

0	The

0	On

0	Our

0	Early
0	on

0	expressing

0	On

0	at

0	finding
0	the
0	land
0	to
0	trend

0	we

0	A

0	came
0	on
0	,
0	and
0	both

0	stood
0	to

0	.

0	When
0	they
0	had
0	cut
0	down
0	what
0	best
0	suited
0	their
0	purpose
0	,
0	the
0	great
0	difficulty
0	was
0	to
0	bring
0	them
0	to
0	the

0	;

0	and
0	would

0	Our

0	had

0	We

0	but
0	this
0	not
0	having
0	the
0	desired
0	effect
0	,
0	a
0	gun
0	from
0	the
0	ships
0	threw
0	them
0	all
0	into

0	.

0	but
0	before
0	night
0	we
0	were
0	again
0	in

0	They
0	were
0	now

0	On

0	But
0	what

0	meant
0	is
0	this
0	.

0	On
0	the
0	16th
0	at

0	we
0	found
0	ourselves

0	a

0	Both

0	instantly

0	to

0	9

0	the

0	within

0	in
0	some

0	.

0	supposing
0	both
0	of
0	the

0	the
0	men
0	therefore
0	in
0	this

0	are
0	busied
0	in

0	,
0	and
0	the

0	curing
0	what
0	they
0	catch
0	.

0	for

0	his
0	throat
0	so
0	parched
0	that
0	he
0	could
0	not
0	speak
0	.

0	These
0	isles
0	are
0	so
0	different
0	from
0	each
0	other
0	in
0	their
0	nature
0	,
0	that
0	we
0	cannot
0	help
0	at
0	first
0	sight
0	observing
0	the
0	striking
0	and
0	material
0	difference
0	.

0	On
0	the
0	24th
0	we
0	continued
0	our
0	course
0	E.
0	S.
0	E.
0	and
0	came
0	in
0	fight
0	of
0	the
0	Resolution
0	,
0	which
0	had
0	likewise
0	received
0	much
0	damage
0	about
0	her
0	bows
0	.

0	These
0	islands
0	,
0	however
0	,
0	we
0	never
0	found
0	,
0	nor
0	the
0	land
0	of
0	De
0	Gama
0	,
0	though
0	we
0	continued
0	searching
0	for
0	them
0	till
0	The
0	19th
0	,
0	when
0	a
0	storm
0	came
0	on

0	and
0	we
0	lost

0	there
0	being
0	not

0	in
0	their
0	war
0	canoes
0	,
0	who
0	we
0	apprehended
0	were
0	come
0	to
0	attack
0	us
0	;

0	It
0	was
0	,
0	as
0	has
0	already
0	been
0	observed

0	and
0	all
0	that
0	he
0	suffered
0	in
0	his
0	person
0	.

0	On
0	the
0	20th
0	,
0	the
0	weather
0	still
0	continuing
0	fine
0	,
0	we
0	pursued
0	our

0	N.

0	with
0	light
0	winds
0	from

0	wherever
0	there

0	there
0	the

0	sounded
0	from
0	twelve

0	and
0	a

0	We
0	were

0	those
0	that
0	are
0	nearest
0	the
0	large
0	mass
0	,
0	are
0	commonly
0	the
0	most
0	solid
0	,
0	and
0	therefore
0	the
0	most
0	proper
0	for
0	supplying
0	the
0	ship
0	with
0	water
0	.

0	and
0	at
0	high-water
0	the

0	were
0	sometimes

0	but
0	she

0	all
0	the

0	,
0	at
0	3
0	P.

0	we
0	altered
0	it

0	stood
0	to

0	but
0	what
0	gave
0	the
0	greatest
0	pleasure
0	to
0	the
0	seamen
0	,
0	was
0	the
0	success
0	they
0	met
0	with
0	in
0	fishing
0	,
0	whenever
0	the
0	weather
0	was
0	such

0	At

0	At

0	but
0	who
0	threw
0	it
0	,
0	no
0	one
0	could
0	tell

0	We
0	got
0	out
0	our

0	thought

0	.

0	The

0	W.
0	At
0	ten
0	in
0	the
0	morning
0	,
0	finding
0	the
0	water
0	to
0	change
0	colour
0	,
0	we
0	sounded
0	at
0	17
0	fathom
0	,
0	and
0	looking
0	a-head
0	,
0	saw
0	a
0	large
0	reef
0	,
0	not
0	above
0	two
0	cables
0	length
0	before
0	us
0	.

0	These
0	they
0	forwarded
0	with
0	the
0	utmost
0	expedition
0	,
0	every
0	one
0	being
0	eager
0	to
0	get
0	to
0	his
0	native
0	country
0	.

0	He
0	confirmed
0	Loreman
0	's
0	relation
0	of
0	what
0	passed
0	while
0	they
0	remained
0	together
0	;

0	It
0	was
0	now
0	their
0	spring
0	,
0	and
0	the
0	weather
0	began
0	to
0	change
0	for
0	the
0	better
0	.

0	In
0	the
0	evening
0	,
0	the
0	boats
0	were
0	got
0	out
0	,
0	and
0	the
0	Captain
0	,
0	with
0	several
0	other
0	gentlemen
0	,
0	went
0	on
0	shore
0	;

0	and
0	after
0	paddling
0	round
0	the
0	ships
0	,
0	instead
0	of
0	going
0	on
0	board
0	as
0	was
0	expected
0	,
0	they
0	made
0	towards
0	the
0	shore
0	,
0	at
0	the
0	beach
0	where
0	our
0	men
0	were
0	stationed
0	.

0	For
0	it
0	had
0	its
0	origin
0	either
0	near
0	some
0	land
0	,
0	or
0	in
0	the
0	open
0	ocean
0	.

0	Lat
0	.

0	and
0	that
0	it
0	was
0	increasing
0	;

0	and
0	,
0	though
0	the
0	still
0	had
0	been
0	constantly
0	at
0	work
0	,
0	our
0	complement
0	began
0	already
0	to
0	run
0	scanty
0	.

0	Here
0	we
0	saw
0	high
0	land
0	,
0	extending
0	from
0	N.
0	by
0	W.
0	to
0	N.
0	W.
0	by
0	N.
0	distant
0	about
0	three
0	leagues
0	.

0	It
0	is
0	stagnant
0	,
0	bad
0	and
0	somewhat
0	brackish
0	.

0	On
0	their
0	return
0	,
0	they
0	brought
0	a
0	dismal
0	account
0	of
0	the
0	condition
0	of
0	the
0	Resolution
0	;

0	We
0	were
0	therefore
0	no
0	sooner
0	released
0	,
0	than
0	we
0	weighed
0	anchor
0	and
0	steered
0	to
0	the
0	eastward
0	.

0	We
0	were
0	now
0	about
0	two
0	leagues
0	distant
0	from
0	the
0	shore
0	,
0	which
0	was
0	covered
0	with
0	geese
0	,
0	ducks
0	,
0	shags
0	,
0	and
0	sea-fowls
0	,
0	innumerable
0	.

0	She
0	looked
0	at
0	us
0	,
0	but
0	made
0	sail
0	to
0	the
0	westward
0	,
0	and
0	we
0	continued
0	our
0	course
0	.

0	and
0	meeting
0	with
0	another
0	man
0	,
0	with
0	two
0	dried
0	salmon
0	in
0	his
0	canoe
0	,
0	took
0	them
0	from
0	him
0	,
0	and
0	brought
0	them
0	to
0	the
0	Captain
0	.

0	The
0	subaltern
0	,
0	in
0	the
0	mean
0	time
0	,
0	shewed
0	us
0	every
0	civility
0	.

0	It
0	was
0	now
0	agreed
0	,
0	to
0	make
0	the
0	best
0	of
0	their
0	way
0	to
0	the
0	eminence
0	,
0	but
0	this
0	proved
0	not
0	so
0	easy
0	a
0	task
0	as
0	it
0	at
0	first
0	appeared
0	to
0	be
0	.

0	Lat
0	.

0	As
0	the
0	weather
0	was
0	now
0	clear
0	,
0	though
0	piercing
0	cold
0	,
0	we
0	could
0	see
0	the
0	ice
0	extending
0	on
0	every
0	side
0	E.
0	and
0	W.
0	as
0	far
0	as
0	the
0	eye
0	could
0	carry
0	.

0	We
0	were
0	now
0	in
0	Beering
0	's
0	Straits
0	.

0	The
0	day
0	after
0	this
0	happened
0	the
0	Captain
0	,
0	with
0	his
0	Lieutenant
0	,
0	and
0	nine
0	marines
0	,
0	landed
0	.

0	On
0	the
0	3d
0	,
0	at
0	half
0	an
0	hour
0	after
0	four
0	in
0	the
0	morning
0	,
0	Mount
0	Edgecomb
0	,
0	bore
0	S.

0	The
0	country
0	began
0	now
0	to
0	put
0	on
0	a
0	new
0	face
0	.

0	nor
0	were
0	they
0	then
0	relieved
0	from
0	hard
0	duty
0	,
0	when
0	our
0	gentlemen
0	left
0	the
0	ship
0	;

0	August
0	the
0	1st
0	,
0	the
0	sea
0	continued
0	to

0	,
0	but
0	the
0	land
0	trending
0	to
0	the
0	southward
0	,
0	obliged
0	us
0	to
0	change
0	our
0	course
0	.

0	lay
0	by
0	most
0	part
0	of
0	the
0	day
0	;

0	•
0	•
0	.

0	40
0	min
0	.

0	but
0	they
0	too
0	,
0	when
0	we
0	approached
0	them
0	,
0	appeared
0	all
0	in
0	one
0	.

0	The
0	houses
0	here
0	are
0	warmer
0	,
0	as
0	the
0	air
0	is
0	colder
0	.

0	they
0	were
0	therefore
0	encouraged
0	,
0	by
0	the
0	report
0	of
0	the
0	natives
0	,
0	to
0	make
0	themselves
0	known
0	,
0	and
0	to
0	offer
0	their
0	assistance
0	as
0	far
0	as
0	lay
0	in
0	their
0	power
0	.

0	We
0	hauled
0	upon
0	a
0	wind
0	,
0	and
0	stood
0	E.
0	N.
0	E.
0	till
0	two
0	in
0	the
0	afternoon
0	,
0	when
0	we
0	passed
0	a
0	small
0	island
0	,
0	called
0	by
0	the
0	Russians
0	St.
0	Nicholas
0	;

0	Their
0	grog
0	,
0	that
0	had
0	been
0	stopped
0	as
0	soon
0	as
0	we
0	arrived
0	upon
0	the
0	coast
0	,
0	was
0	again
0	dealt
0	out
0	to
0	them
0	as
0	usual
0	;

0	Fortunately
0	it
0	ceased
0	freezing
0	in
0	the
0	night
0	.

0	Being
0	now
0	well
0	in
0	with
0	the
0	ice
0	,
0	and
0	having
0	lost
0	sight
0	of
0	land
0	,
0	we
0	kept
0	working
0	to
0	the
0	westward
0	.

0	that
0	the
0	ice
0	floating
0	in
0	the
0	ocean
0	is
0	all
0	fresh
0	,
0	that
0	salt
0	water
0	does
0	not
0	freeze
0	at
0	all
0	,
0	or
0	if
0	it
0	does
0	,
0	it
0	contains
0	briny
0	particles
0	;

0	and
0	by
0	signs
0	,
0	prevailed
0	on
0	them
0	to
0	receive
0	some
0	trifling
0	presents
0	.

0	for
0	the
0	observatory
0	is
0	but
0	a
0	few
0	feet
0	above
0	that
0	level
0	.

0	All
0	these
0	,
0	though
0	the
0	weather
0	was
0	cold
0	,
0	they
0	parted
0	with
0	,
0	and
0	most
0	of
0	them
0	went
0	naked
0	from
0	the
0	ships
0	,
0	making
0	signs
0	for
0	us
0	to
0	follow
0	them
0	,
0	though
0	it
0	was
0	not
0	easy
0	to
0	discover
0	from
0	whence
0	they
0	came
0	,
0	nor
0	where
0	they
0	were
0	to
0	go
0	.

0	but
0	at
0	ten
0	the
0	current
0	ran
0	so
0	strong
0	,
0	that
0	both
0	ships
0	were
0	again
0	obliged
0	to
0	cast
0	anchor
0	in
0	24
0	fathom
0	,
0	bottom
0	same
0	as
0	before
0	.

0	We
0	were
0	now
0	in
0	lat
0	.

0	but
0	as
0	the
0	100
0	feet
0	,
0	are
0	only
0	the
0	contents
0	of
0	the
0	ice
0	above
0	water
0	,
0	the
0	same
0	must
0	be
0	taken
0	nine
0	times
0	more
0	for
0	the
0	contents
0	under
0	water
0	;

0	Early
0	in
0	the
0	morning
0	on
0	the
0	2d
0	we
0	weighed
0	,
0	and
0	soon
0	came
0	in
0	sight
0	of
0	the
0	Resolution
0	;

0	so
0	that
0	a
0	ship
0	touching
0	here
0	,
0	must
0	expect
0	nothing
0	but
0	fish
0	and
0	turtle
0	;

0	but
0	of
0	what
0	nation
0	,
0	we
0	were
0	unable
0	to
0	discover
0	.

0	On
0	the
0	North
0	side
0	of
0	the
0	isle
0	we
0	saw
0	a
0	large
0	place
0	with
0	the
0	evident
0	appearance
0	of
0	being
0	lately
0	burnt
0	by
0	fire
0	.

0	they
0	would
0	have
0	excused
0	themselves
0	on
0	account
0	of
0	dress
0	,
0	but
0	the
0	Governor
0	would
0	admit
0	no
0	apology
0	.

0	On
0	the
0	7th
0	,
0	the
0	artificers
0	again
0	resumed
0	their
0	labour
0	.

0	Our
0	gentlemen
0	were
0	here
0	shewn
0	the
0	stores
0	belonging
0	to
0	the
0	factory
0	,
0	consisting
0	of
0	skins
0	and
0	oil
0	;

0	They
0	were
0	scarcely
0	of
0	the
0	size
0	of
0	the
0	smallest
0	pin
0	's
0	head
0	.

0	The
0	10th
0	,
0	blew
0	a
0	heavy
0	gale
0	from
0	N.
0	N.
0	W.
0	hauled
0	out
0	wind
0	to
0	N.
0	E.
0	On
0	the
0	11th
0	,
0	bore
0	away
0	again
0	S.
0	by
0	W.
0	but
0	,
0	the
0	gale
0	increasing
0	towards
0	night
0	,
0	hauled
0	our
0	wind
0	to
0	the
0	Northward
0	.

0	On
0	the
0	28th
0	we
0	unmoored
0	;

0	In
0	1775
0	,
0	in
0	January
0	the
0	27th
0	,
0	we
0	saw
0	ice
0	in
0	about
0	60
0	°
0	South
0	latitude
0	.

0	and
0	they
0	never
0	again
0	offered
0	the
0	least
0	violence
0	during
0	our
0	stay
0	.

0	We
0	learned
0	that
0	the
0	name
0	of
0	the
0	island
0	we
0	had
0	just
0	left
0	,
0	was
0	Woahoo
0	,
0	lat
0	.

0	and
0	leaving
0	the
0	water
0	undisturbed
0	,
0	we
0	saw
0	the
0	little
0	sparks
0	moving
0	very
0	briskly
0	in
0	different
0	directions
0	.

0	We
0	instantly
0	began
0	to
0	clear
0	ship
0	,
0	in
0	case
0	of
0	an
0	enemy
0	,
0	and
0	hoisted
0	English
0	colours
0	;

0	and
0	had
0	been
0	driven
0	from
0	island
0	to
0	island
0	among
0	the
0	ice
0	,
0	till
0	our
0	ships
0	had
0	in
0	a
0	manner
0	lost
0	their
0	sheathing
0	,
0	and
0	were
0	otherwise
0	in
0	a
0	shattered
0	condition
0	;

0	All
0	attempts
0	therefore
0	of
0	succeeding
0	by
0	this
0	course
0	appeared
0	to
0	be
0	labour
0	lost
0	;

0	About
0	eight
0	at
0	night
0	it
0	blew
0	a
0	gale
0	,
0	with
0	heavy
0	snow
0	;

0	and
0	higher
0	up
0	of
0	an
0	indurated
0	clay
0	.

0	On
0	the
0	24th
0	,
0	little
0	wind
0	and
0	hazy
0	.

0	and
0	in
0	that
0	he
0	happened
0	to
0	judge
0	right
0	;

0	These
0	were
0	received
0	with
0	open
0	arms
0	;

0	On
0	the
0	19th
0	,
0	we
0	coasted
0	along
0	shore
0	,
0	and
0	passed
0	many
0	dangerous
0	rocks
0	and
0	shoals
0	,
0	which
0	we
0	saw
0	project
0	from
0	the
0	main
0	into
0	the
0	sea
0	to
0	a
0	great
0	distance
0	.

0	All
0	hands
0	were
0	now
0	busy
0	at
0	work
0	on
0	their
0	different
0	employments
0	.

0	They
0	have
0	different
0	masks
0	for
0	different
0	purposes
0	;

0	N.
0	long
0	.

0	We
0	then
0	sounded
0	sixty-four
0	fathom
0	,
0	and
0	stood
0	from
0	S.
0	to
0	S.
0	E.
0	by
0	E.
0	Lat
0	.

0	They
0	observed
0	a
0	remarkable
0	conformity
0	between
0	those
0	charts
0	exhibited
0	by
0	the
0	Russians
0	as
0	far
0	as
0	they
0	went
0	,
0	and
0	their
0	own
0	.

0	They
0	brought
0	with
0	them
0	curiosities
0	of
0	various
0	kinds
0	and
0	shapes
0	;

0	the
0	extreme
0	of
0	which
0	bore
0	S.
0	E.
0	At
0	two
0	,
0	P.
0	M.
0	saw
0	more
0	land
0	,
0	trending
0	to
0	the
0	southward
0	.

0	On
0	the
0	21st
0	,
0	we
0	were
0	in
0	lat
0	.

0	The
0	29th
0	was
0	appointed
0	for
0	the
0	interment
0	;

0	Two
0	were
0	seen
0	to
0	drop
0	;

0	At
0	ten
0	the
0	same
0	morning
0	,
0	we
0	had

0	the

0	when
0	both

0	They

0	We

0	in

0	In

0	N.

0	His

0	had
0	the

0	and
0	next

0	we
0	purchased

0	The

0	stood
0	W.

0	This

0	We

0	visited
0	daily
0	by
0	strangers

0	who
0	came
0	out
0	of
0	curiosity
0	to
0	see
0	ships
0	that
0	had
0	been
0	so
0	many
0	years
0	upon

0	;

0	E.
0	On
0	the

0	,
0	saw

0	and
0	about
0	noon
0	passed
0	several
0	large
0	masses
0	of
0	ice
0	.

0	At
0	night
0	we
0	came
0	to
0	an
0	anchor
0	with
0	the
0	tide
0	.

0	All
0	these
0	were
0	received
0	with

0	possible
0	respect
0	.

0	N.
0	and
0	long
0	.

0	About
0	twelve
0	at
0	noon
0	we
0	hauled
0	upon

0	S.
0	W.

0	As
0	we
0	found
0	the
0	coast
0	rugged
0	with
0	high
0	rocks
0	above
0	water
0	,
0	we
0	suspected

0	Except
0	the

0	that
0	happened
0	,
0	of
0	which
0	we
0	have
0	already

0	we
0	had
0	not
0	the

0	difference
0	with
0	any
0	of
0	the
0	natives
0	during
0	our
0	stay
0	.

0	We
0	examined
0	the
0	inside
0	of
0	one
0	.

0	We
0	again
0	hoisted
0	English
0	colours
0	,
0	but
0	she
0	paid
0	no
0	attention
0	to
0	them
0	,
0	and
0	we
0	pursued
0	our

0	.

0	The

0	from

0	a

0	returned

0	that
0	no

0	be
0	found
0	in
0	that

0	but
0	,
0	after
0	continuing
0	that
0	course
0	all
0	night
0	without
0	succeeding
0	,
0	we
0	again
0	stood
0	to
0	the
0	North
0	.

0	that
0	he
0	saw
0	it
0	cut
0	from
0	the

0	,
0	but
0	believed
0	that
0	all
0	the

0	of
0	the

0	was
0	burnt

0	the
0	wood
0	had
0	drifted
0	from

0	for

0	saw
0	no
0	trees
0	,
0	but
0	black

0	.

0	and
0	we
0	found
0	ourselves
0	in
0	the
0	middle
0	of
0	a
0	deep
0	bay
0	,
0	but
0	very

0	sometimes

0	but
0	never
0	above
0	five
0	fathoms
0	and
0	a

0	.

0	This
0	day
0	we
0	passed
0	the
0	barren
0	isles
0	.

0	This
0	called
0	upon
0	the
0	Captain
0	to
0	make
0	a
0	considerable
0	addition
0	to
0	his
0	present
0	,
0	with
0	which
0	the
0	chief
0	was
0	so
0	pleased
0	,
0	that
0	he
0	pulled
0	off
0	his
0	beaver-skin
0	cloak
0	,
0	and
0	laid
0	it
0	at
0	his

0	.

0	Lat
0	.

0	We
0	made
0	the
0	signal
0	to
0	the
0	Discovery
0	to
0	prepare
0	for
0	action
0	,
0	and
0	we
0	did
0	the
0	same
0	,
0	hoisting
0	English
0	colours
0	.

0	This
0	they
0	did
0	without
0	the
0	least
0	interruption
0	from
0	any
0	of
0	the
0	inhabitants
0	.

0	We
0	made
0	sail
0	,
0	and
0	stood
0	right
0	in

0	It
0	was
0	then
0	concluded

0	lost
0	their

0	,
0	or
0	some

0	had
0	befallen

0	;

0	The
0	cattle
0	were
0	mere

0	,
0	which
0	we
0	were
0	glad
0	to
0	accept
0	at
0	first
0	coming
0	;

0	But
0	numbers
0	make
0	that
0	easy

0	which
0	to

0	would
0	be
0	impracticable
0	.

0	On

0	This

0	At

0	the

0	,
0	at

0	in
0	the

0	,
0	we

0	freezing
0	cold
0	all

0	At
0	noon
0	a
0	great
0	fog
0	came
0	on
0	,
0	but
0	soon
0	clearing
0	up
0	,
0	the

0	made
0	his

0	,
0	and
0	we
0	had
0	an

0	,
0	by
0	which
0	we
0	found
0	we
0	were
0	in

0	He

0	,
0	there
0	were
0	only
0	two

0	on
0	the

0	of
0	Kamtschatka
0	that
0	were
0	fit

0	On
0	the

0	,
0	1778
0	,
0	about
0	ten
0	in
0	the
0	morning
0	,
0	we
0	unmoored
0	,
0	and
0	set
0	sail
0	,
0	with
0	the
0	Resolution
0	in
0	company

0	directing
0	our

0	with
0	a
0	gentle
0	breeze
0	from
0	the
0	East
0	.

0	On
0	the
0	29th
0	we
0	again
0	stood
0	S.
0	half
0	W.
0	and
0	in
0	the

0	observed
0	another

0	but
0	as
0	soon
0	as
0	the
0	fog
0	cleared
0	up
0	,
0	we
0	found
0	ourselves
0	in
0	the
0	entrance
0	of
0	a
0	vast
0	river
0	,
0	supposed
0	to

0	lat
0	.

0	but
0	the
0	leak
0	was
0	out
0	of
0	our
0	reach
0	;

0	He
0	likewise
0	brought
0	a
0	confirmation
0	of
0	the
0	French
0	war
0	,
0	and
0	of
0	the

0	All

0	Their

0	too
0	had

0	Early
0	on
0	the
0	21st
0	a
0	storm
0	came
0	on

0	now
0	,
0	peace
0	being

0	all
0	the

0	of

0	taken

0	to
PLACE-B	Kamshatska

0	.

0	On
0	the

0	,
0	being
0	then
0	in

0	While
0	we
0	remained

0	,
0	no
0	people
0	on

0	could
0	be

0	We

0	N.
0	at
0	one
0	of
0	which
0	we
0	anchored
0	,
0	and
0	found
0	it

0	.

0	She
0	had
0	met
0	with
0	some

0	in

0	and
0	rigging
0	;

0	In
0	the
0	morning
0	of
0	the
0	13th
0	we
0	stood
0	once
0	more
0	north
0	eastward
0	.

0	In
0	the
0	evening
0	we
0	saw
0	a
0	large
0	body
0	of
0	Indians
0	towing
0	a
0	whale
0	which
0	they
0	had
0	struck
0	,
0	who
0	were
0	too
0	busy

0	mind
0	us
0	till
0	late
0	,
0	when
0	two
0	canoes
0	came
0	along-side
0	and
0	traded
0	.

0	This
0	afternoon
0	,
0	several
0	indications
0	of
0	land
0	were
0	observed
0	;

0	On
0	the
0	7th
0	,
0	judging
0	ourselves
0	near
0	the
0	shore
0	,
0	though
0	not
0	in
0	sight
0	,
0	we
0	weighed

0	distant
0	between
0	six
0	and
0	seven

0	.

0	They
0	then
0	desired
0	to
0	be
0	set
0	at
0	liberty
0	,
0	which
0	was
0	granted
0	.

0	Lat
0	.

0	Lat
0	.

0	We
0	were
0	then
0	in
0	lat
0	.

0	These
0	were
0	the
0	islands
0	of
0	St.
0	Diomede
0	,
0	in
0	the
0	midway
0	between
0	the
0	two
0	Continents

0	even
0	the
0	sea-fowl
0	were
0	hardly
0	to

0	come
0	at
0	,
0	they
0	were
0	so
0	watchful
0	.

0	Lat
0	.

0	On
0	the
0	30th
0	we
0	wore
0	ship
0	,
0	and
0	stood
0	to
0	the
0	Southward
0	,
0	and
0	about
0	eleven
0	in
0	the
0	morning
0	,
0	the
0	man
0	at
0	the
0	mast-head
0	called
0	out
0	,
0	Land
0	,
0	bearing
0	W.
0	½
0	S.
0	distant
0	about
0	three
0	leagues

0	for
0	several
0	of
0	them
0	lay
0	dead
0	,
0	that
0	had
0	been
0	killed
0	that
0	morning
0	.

0	but
0	that
0	was
0	not
0	yet
0	to
0	be
0	obtained
0	.

0	In
0	the
0	mean
0	time
0	,
0	several
0	canoes
0	came
0	from
0	the
0	shore
0	with
0	plantains
0	and
0	dried
0	fish
0	on
0	board
0	,
0	who
0	parted
0	with
0	what
0	they
0	had
0	for
0	any
0	trifles
0	that
0	were
0	offered
0	them
0	;

0	At
0	this
0	time
0	we
0	had
0	not
0	one
0	man
0	on
0	the
0	sick
0	list
0	on
0	board
0	the
0	Discovery
0	.

0	They
0	have
0	no
0	teeth
0	;

0	Thermometer
0	fifty
0	nine
0	and
0	a
0	half
0	.

0	and
0	they
0	had
0	promised
0	themselves
0	great
0	sport
0	in
0	pursuing
0	them
0	;

0	but
0	what
0	they
0	valued
0	most
0	was
0	tobacco
0	.

0	and
0	in
0	this
0	labour
0	they
0	were
0	assisted
0	by
0	the
0	natives
0	.

0	At
0	nine
0	in
0	the
0	evening
0	we
0	came
0	in
0	sight
0	of
0	the
0	American
0	shore
0	,
0	distant
0	about
0	six
0	leagues
0	.

0	Our
0	Captain
0	observing
0	their
0	motions
0	,
0	ordered
0	the
0	guns
0	to
0	be
0	shotted
0	,
0	and
0	every
0	man
0	to
0	his
0	post
0	.

0	We
0	immediately
0	made
0	signals
0	,
0	and
0	acquainted
0	our
0	Commodore
0	with
0	our
0	distress
0	.

0	On
0	the
0	30th
0	,
0	they
0	set
0	sail
0	;

0	On
0	the
0	13th
0	,
0	about
0	eight
0	in
0	the
0	morning
0	,
0	we
0	wore
0	ship
0	,
0	and
0	stood
0	W.
0	by
0	S.
0	heavy
0	rain
0	,
0	and
0	snow
0	.

0	consequently
0	it
0	is
0	evident
0	,
0	that
0	it
0	must
0	have
0	drifted
0	to
0	these
0	low
0	latitudes
0	from
0	beyond
0	60
0	°
0	,
0	67
0	°
0	,
0	and
0	71
0	°
0	South
0	latitude
0	.

0	c.
0	and
0	therefore
0	when
0	we
0	fell
0	in
0	with
0	such
0	quantities
0	of
0	ice
0	in
0	December
0	,
0	1772
0	,
0	I
0	expected
0	we
0	should
0	soon
0	meet
0	with
0	the
0	land
0	,
0	from
0	whence
0	these
0	ice
0	masses
0	had
0	been
0	detached
0	.

0	that
0	they
0	did
0	not
0	arrive
0	at
0	Canton
0	till
0	the
0	24th
0	;

0	sounding
0	every
0	day
0	,
0	and
0	every
0	day
0	in
0	danger
0	of
0	perishing
0	on
0	the
0	rocks
0	.

0	We
0	continued
0	our
0	course
0	along
0	shore
0	,
0	with
0	regular
0	soundings
0	at
0	about
0	54
0	fathom
0	,
0	free
0	from
0	reefs
0	,
0	and
0	a
0	very
0	bold
0	shore
0	.

0	The
0	next
0	circumstance
0	relative
0	to
0	the
0	mountains
0	is
0	their
0	height
0	.

0	Both
0	these
0	experiments
0	therefore
0	by
0	no
0	means
0	prove
0	what
0	the
0	Dr.
0	intended
0	to
0	infer
0	from
0	thence
0	;

0	and
0	it
0	being
0	now
0	apparent
0	that
0	nothing
0	was
0	to
0	be
0	gained
0	by
0	fair
0	means
0	,
0	orders
0	were
0	given
0	to
0	strike
0	terror
0	among
0	them
0	,
0	by
0	pursuing
0	them
0	with
0	fire
0	and
0	sword
0	.

0	but
0	no
0	farther
0	discovery
0	could
0	be
0	made
0	,
0	but
0	that
0	it
0	had
0	been
0	taken
0	from
0	a
0	part
0	of
0	a
0	large
0	ship
0	that
0	had
0	been
0	drifted
0	on
0	the
0	coast
0	since
0	our
0	leaving
0	the
0	island
0	in
0	1778
0	.

0	This
0	tree
0	was
0	at
0	some
0	distance
0	from
0	the
0	town
0	,
0	and
0	near
0	the
0	hospital
0	,
0	round
0	which
0	several
0	people
0	had
0	already
0	been
0	buried
0	;

0	c
0	.

0	also
0	,
0	dried
0	fish
0	in
0	plenty
0	.

0	On
0	the
0	13th
0	we
0	were
0	in
0	lat
0	.

0	This
0	was
0	the
0	only
0	Chief
0	of
0	note
0	seen
0	upon
0	this
0	island
0	.

0	We
0	had
0	quantities
0	of
0	it
0	when
0	we
0	reached
PLACE-B	Kamshatska
0	,
0	and
0	as
0	good
0	as
0	when
0	first
0	purchased
0	.

0	About
0	four
0	,
0	split
0	the
0	main
0	top-sail
0	.

0	Having
0	gratified
0	our
0	curiosity
0	,
0	we
0	returned
0	to
0	our
0	ships
0	;

0	Here
0	several
0	canoes
0	came
0	from
0	the
0	land
0	to
0	trade
0	,
0	and
0	made
0	signs
0	for
0	more
0	tobacco
0	,
0	of
0	which
0	our
0	own
0	men
0	were
0	in
0	great
0	want
0	.

0	and
0	,
0	besides
0	cloth
0	,
0	they
0	had
0	many
0	other
0	articles
0	which
0	shewed
0	that
0	they
0	had
0	artificers
0	among
0	them
0	not
0	wanting
0	in
0	ingenuity
0	.

0	He
0	was
0	told
0	that
0	the
0	tumultuous
0	appearance
0	of
0	his
0	people
0	,
0	and
0	their
0	repeated
0	robberies
0	,
0	made
0	some
0	uncommon
0	severities
0	necessary
0	;

0	nor
0	had
0	she
0	fresh
0	provisions
0	sufficient
0	to

0	her
0	people
0	for

0	.

0	And
0	about
0	four
0	in
0	the
0	afternoon
0	both
0	ships
0	came
0	to

0	a

0	muddy

0	but
0	on
0	their
0	nearer
0	approach
0	,
0	we
0	found
0	they
0	were
0	all
0	armed

0	clothed
0	in

0	manner
0	.

0	Thermometer
0	52

0	At
0	ten
0	in
0	the
0	morning
0	,
0	saw
0	a

0	,
0	bearing
0	from

0	N.

0	distance

0	These

0	,
0	if

0	may
0	be
0	so
0	called
0	,
0	were
0	some
0	of

0	forty
0	feet
0	long
0	,
0	thirty

0	,
0	and
0	about

0	but

0	make

0	The

0	In

0	We

0	On

0	About

0	On

0	the

0	probable
0	,
0	that

0	On
0	the

0	we

0	with
0	very
0	little
0	variation
0	,
0	till
0	night
0	,
0	when
0	a

0	came
0	on
0	,
0	and
0	we
0	lost
0	sight
0	of

0	.

0	About
0	four
0	P.
0	M.
0	we

0	On
0	the

0	our
0	Captain
0	with

0	We

0	neither
0	women
0	nor

0	On
0	the

0	we

0	The

0	The
0	cove
0	,
0	in
0	which
0	we

0	but
0	on

0	,
0	found

0	At

0	the

0	both

0	employed
0	themselves
0	in

0	,
0	and
0	very
0	fortunately
0	caught
0	a
0	great
0	number
0	of
0	large
0	cod
0	,
0	which
0	were
0	equally
0	distributed
0	among

0	We

0	not

0	Here
0	they
0	saw
0	an

0	between

0	and
0	were
0	in
0	doubt

0	not
0	take
0	an

0	;

0	On
0	the
0	15th

0	sounded

0	found
0	no

0	Fortunately
0	for

0	,
0	its

0	in

0	abated

0	but
0	none

0	Here

0	though
0	farther

0	At

0	but
0	the

0	,
0	for

0	Here

0	just
0	opposite

0	a
0	small
0	rivulet
0	of
0	excellent

0	,
0	the

0	were

0	,
0	and
0	the

0	In

0	a

0	as
0	a

0	at

0	saw

0	appear
0	just
0	above
0	water
0	.

0	On
0	the

0	a

0	leading
0	them
0	to
0	every

0	,
0	to

0	for
0	afterwards
0	it
0	would
0	have
0	been
0	equally
0	impossible
0	for

0	to

0	recovered
0	his
0	station
0	here
0	,
0	as

0	in

0	.

0	At
0	ten
0	it
0	became
0	very

0	and
0	dark
0	.

0	We
0	saw
0	no

0	instruments
0	among

0	In
0	pursuit
0	of

0	,
0	of
0	which
0	there
0	was
0	plenty
0	,
0	our

0	fell
0	in

0	one

0	the

0	,
0	apparently
0	of
0	an
0	equal
0	height
0	with
0	the
0	former

0	We
0	continued
0	working

0	the

0	till
0	The

0	when
0	by

0	On
0	the

0	very

0	,
0	and
0	covered

0	.

0	During

0	two

0	at

0	.

0	About

0	At

0	We

0	From

0	nothing

0	happened
0	,

0	We
0	shook
0	out
0	our

0	,
0	and
0	made

0	On

0	the
0	S.

0	with
0	a

0	Nothing

0	This

0	joyful
0	news
0	.

0	They
0	went
0	on
0	chearfully

0	On

0	,
0	in
0	the

0	the

0	were
0	sent
0	on

0	,
0	where
0	they
0	saw
0	some

0	of
0	a

0	;

0	All
0	this

0	our

0	on

0	no

0	while
0	it
0	was
0	day-light
0	,
0	after

0	we

0	off

0	to
0	the

0	continued
0	till
0	The

0	,
0	when
0	,
0	in
0	lat
0	.

0	I
0	have
0	however
0	in
0	some
0	instances
0	observed
0	just
0	the
0	contrary
0	;

0	The
0	Indians
0	who
0	dug
0	his
0	grave
0	about
0	four
0	feet
0	deep
0	,
0	covered

0	The
0	ice
0	floats
0	in
0	an

0	,
0	which
0	in
0	the
0	summer
0	of
0	the
0	Southern
0	hemisphere
0	was
0	observed
0	to
0	be
0	many
0	degrees
0	above
0	the
0	freezing
0	point
0	;

0	with
0	this
0	difference
0	only
0	,
0	that
0	they
0	are
0	not
0	so
0	high
0	or
0	so
0	rocky
0	as
0	the
0	latter
0	.

0	They
0	likewise
0	exchanged
0	four
0	small
0	cannon
0	and
0	some
0	shot
0	with
0	the
0	Discovery
0	for
0	a

0	in

0	The

0	the

0	Some

0	.

0	From
0	intense
0	heat
0	,
0	it
0	became
0	piercing
0	cold
0	;

0	which
0	was
0	the
0	more
0	noticed
0	as
0	those
0	birds
0	are
0	never
0	seen
0	far
0	from
0	land
0	,
0	and
0	none
0	was

0	We
0	bore
0	away
0	under
0	the
0	lee
0	of
0	the
0	Westernmost
0	,
0	and
0	continued

0	all
0	night
0	S.

0	W.
0	On
0	the
0	25th
0	,
0	in

0	that

0	On

0	obliged
0	to
0	do
0	the

0	When

0	they
0	made

0	Hogs
0	,
0	and
0	the

0	sent
0	out

0	.

0	At

0	our

0	very
0	indifferent
0	,

0	no

0	,
0	On
0	the
0	14th
0	,
0	we
0	stood
0	again
0	N.
0	by
0	E.
0	with
0	a
0	light
0	breeze
0	.

0	It
0	then
0	bore
0	S.
0	W.
0	distant
0	seven
0	or
0	eight
0	leagues
0	,
0	and
0	appeared
0	like
0	a
0	burning
0	mountain
0	,
0	from
0	whence
0	proceeded
0	,
0	as
0	was

0	on

0	,
0	all
0	the

0	we
0	had
0	seen
0	.

0	Little
0	notice
0	,
0	however
0	,
0	was
0	taken
0	of
0	what
0	passed
0	.

0	We
0	saw
0	several
0	of
0	these
0	hot
0	springs
0	near
0	each
0	other
0	;

0	We
0	sent
0	our
0	boat
0	on
0	board
0	,
0	and
0	received
0	the
0	first
0	news
0	of
0	a
0	Spanish
0	war
0	.

0	we
0	therefore
0	shortened
0	our
0	stay
0	.

0	whereupon
0	they
0	agreed
0	to
0	part
0	.

0	On
0	the
0	same
0	cliff
0	,
0	but
0	close
0	to
0	the
0	sandy
0	beach
0	,
0	at
0	the
0	bottom
0	of
0	the
0	harbour
0	,
0	there
0	are
0	two
0	other
0	hot
0	springs
0	.

0	driven
0	out
0	to
0	sea
0	,
0	by
0	one
0	storm
0	,
0	and
0	in
0	danger
0	of
0	being
0	wrecked
0	on
0	the
0	breakers
0	by
0	another
0	.

0	We
0	passed
0	several
0	islands
0	to
0	the
0	Eastward
0	,
0	very
0	high
0	and
0	mountainous
0	.

0	it
0	was
0	,
0	however
0	,
0	of
0	short
0	continuance
0	.

0	both
0	dress
0	exactly
0	in
0	the
0	same
0	manner
0	;

0	if
0	we
0	moreover
0	consider
0	,
0	that
0	these
0	severe
0	frosts
0	are
0	continued
0	during
0	six
0	or
0	eight
0	months
0	of
0	the
0	year
0	,
0	we
0	may
0	easily
0	conceive
0	that
0	there
0	is
0	time
0	enough
0	to
0	congeal
0	large
0	and
0	extensive
0	masses
0	of
0	ice
0	.

0	And
0	On
0	the
0	2d
0	,
0	about
0	five
0	in
0	the
0	morning
0	,
0	we
0	made
0	land
0	;

0	Some
0	approached
0	near
0	one
0	another
0	,
0	and
0	when
0	a
0	small
0	one
0	came
0	near
0	a
0	larger
0	,
0	it
0	made
0	all
0	possible
0	haste
0	to
0	fly
0	from
0	the
0	danger
0	.

0	and
0	at
0	last
0	,
0	the
0	cutter
0	belonging
0	to
0	the
0	Discovery
0	was
0	cut
0	loose
0	and
0	carried
0	away
0	.

0	He
0	had
0	likewise
0	purchased
0	all
0	such
0	necessaries
0	for
0	the
0	ship
0	's
0	use
0	,
0	as
0	the
0	inhabitants
0	could
0	supply
0	:
0	and
0	it
0	was
0	fortunate
0	that
0	he
0	had
0	so
0	done
0	,
0	before
0	the
0	storm
0	came
0	on
0	;

0	They
0	have
0	,
0	like
0	the
0	seals
0	,
0	some
0	little
0	hair
0	upon
0	their
0	skins
0	,
0	but
0	very
0	thin
0	;

0	We
0	continued
0	labouring
0	among
0	the
0	ice
0	till
0	the
0	25th
0	,
0	when
0	a
0	storm
0	came
0	on
0	,
0	which
0	made
0	it
0	dangerous
0	for
0	us
0	to
0	proceed
0	;

0	in
0	a
0	sea
0	covered
0	with
0	high
0	and
0	extensive
0	ice
0	islands
0	,
0	the

0	should
0	be
0	colder
0	than
0	in
0	a

0	which
0	is
0	at

0	On

0	,

0	THE
0	last
0	and
0	most
0	considerable
0	body
0	of
0	water
0	is
0	the
0	ocean
0	.

0	but
0	not
0	a
0	man
0	could
0	make
0	out
0	more
0	than
0	something
0	like
0	the
0	date
0	1778
0	,
0	of
0	which
0	they
0	were
0	not
0	clear
0	.

0	long
0	.

0	The
0	Resolution
0	was
0	now
0	out
0	of
0	sight
0	,
0	but
0	,
0	judging
0	our
0	distress
0	,
0	she
0	lay
0	to
0	amidst
0	a
0	cluster
0	of
0	islands
0	,
0	of
0	which
0	we
0	told
0	no
0	less
0	than
0	seven
0	,
0	very
0	small
0	but
0	very
0	high
0	.

0	The
0	second
0	objection
0	against
0	the
0	freezing
0	of
0	the
0	ocean
0	into
0	such
0	ice
0	as
0	is
0	found
0	floating
0	in
0	it
0	,
0	is
0	taken
0	from
0	the
0	opacity
0	of
0	ice
0	formed
0	in
0	salt-water
0	;

0	Their
0	canoes
0	were
0	of
0	an
0	uncommon
0	length
0	,
0	many
0	of
0	them
0	from
0	30
0	to
0	40
0	yards
0	long
0	,
0	made
0	of
0	the
0	main
0	body
0	of
0	one
0	of
0	their
0	enormous
0	trees
0	,
0	of
0	which
0	we
0	have
0	already
0	spoken
0	;

0	Their
0	colour
0	is
0	generally
0	a
0	pale
0	yellow
0	,
0	sometimes
0	with
0	a
0	greenish
0	hue
0	.

0	because
0	,
0	in
0	a
0	gale
0	of
0	wind
0	,
0	we
0	could
0	not
0	have
0	been
0	able
0	to
0	make
0	them
0	in
0	a
0	boat
0	.

0	and
0	we
0	saw
0	quantities
0	of
0	salt
0	in
0	wooden
0	troughs
0	.

0	It
0	struck
0	us
0	that
0	it
0	might
0	be
0	human
0	flesh
0	,
0	and
0	the
0	question
0	being
0	put
0	to
0	him
0	,
0	he
0	answered
0	,
0	that
0	the
0	flesh
0	was
0	part
0	of
0	a
0	man
0	.

0	On
0	the
0	15th
0	,
0	we
0	made
0	sail
0	;

0	if
0	this
0	system
0	of
0	the
0	wanted
0	counterpoise
0	be
0	at
0	all
0	necessary
0	.

0	We
0	stood
0	all
0	night
0	with
0	the
0	ship
0	's
0	head
0	S.
0	one-half
0	W.
0	with
0	starboard
0	tacks
0	on
0	board
0	.

0	On
0	the
0	11th
0	of
0	January
0	we
0	unmoored
0	,
0	and
0	the
0	wind
0	being
0	fair
0	,
0	came
0	to
0	sail
0	with
0	a
0	pleasant
0	breeze
0	;

0	and
0	with
0	such
0	circumstances
0	of
0	agreement
0	in
0	the
0	principal
0	facts
0	,
0	as
0	sufficiently
0	prove
0	the
0	authenticity
0	of
0	both
0	.

0	but
0	expressed
0	some
0	apprehensions
0	for
0	her
0	safety
0	,
0	as
0	the
0	boats
0	had
0	been
0	looking
0	out
0	for
0	her
0	several
0	days
0	.

0	It
0	appeared
0	green
0	and
0	fertile
0	.

0	Besides
0	these
0	,
0	we
0	found
0	a
0	reddish
0	lava
0	or
0	tarras
0	,
0	very
0	light
0	and
0	similar
0	to
0	a
0	pumice-stone
0	.

0	Here
0	we
0	found
0	a
0	strong
0	current
0	to
0	set
0	to
0	the
0	S.
0	E.
0	at
0	the
0	rate
0	of
0	five
0	knots
0	an
0	hour
0	.

0	On
0	the
0	29th
0	,
0	at
0	two
0	in
0	the
0	morning
0	,
0	it
0	still
0	continued
0	to
0	blow
0	very
0	hard
0	.

0	On
0	the
0	17th
0	,
0	the
0	party
0	that
0	were
0	sent
0	out
0	to
0	survey
0	the
0	bay
0	returned
0	,
0	after
0	a
0	diligent
0	examination
0	of
0	two
0	days
0	and
0	two
0	nights
0	.

0	The
0	first
0	care
0	of
0	our
0	Commodore
0	was
0	to
0	provide
0	for
0	the
0	sick
0	;

0	About
0	six
0	in
0	the
0	evening
0	,
0	we
0	cast
0	anchor
0	12
0	fathom
0	water
0	,
0	and
0	soon
0	after
0	came
0	to
0	moorings
0	.

0	but
0	upon
0	examination
0	,
0	the
0	town
0	's
0	people
0	were
0	found
0	to
0	be
0	the
0	aggressors
0	.

0	E.
0	many
0	leagues
0	within
0	land
0	,
0	and
0	it
0	was
0	not
0	till
0	the
0	6th
0	that
0	we
0	cleared
0	the
0	channel
0	.

0	Both
0	Captains
0	went
0	instantly
0	to
0	learn
0	the
0	contents
0	;

0	We
0	were
0	frequently
0	visited
0	by
0	such
0	parties
0	,
0	who
0	appeared
0	always
0	in
0	arms
0	,
0	but
0	never
0	offered
0	the
0	least
0	violence
0	.

0	Lat
0	.

0	We
0	tacked
0	every
0	two
0	hours
0	,
0	still
0	working
0	over
0	to
0	the
0	Asiatic
0	shore
0	,
0	with
0	a
0	view
0	to
0	examine
0	the
0	coasts
0	on
0	both
0	sides
0	,
0	before
0	we
0	returned
0	to
0	the
0	southward
0	.

0	That
0	they
0	had
0	some
0	knowledge
0	of
0	iron
0	before
0	we
0	landed
0	among
0	them
0	is
0	certain
0	;

0	We
0	this
0	day
0	stood
0	to
0	the
0	North-East
0	as
0	the
0	land
0	trended
0	.

0	246
0	.

0	but
0	after
0	shewing
0	him
0	some
0	axes
0	,
0	glass
0	bowls
0	,
0	looking-glasses
0	,
0	and
0	other
0	articles
0	that
0	excited
0	his
0	curiosity
0	,
0	he
0	suffered
0	himself
0	to
0	be
0	handed
0	into
0	the
0	ship
0	,
0	where
0	he
0	staid
0	some
0	time
0	,
0	admiring
0	every
0	thing
0	he
0	saw
0	.

0	58.26
0	.

0	In
0	short
0	,
0	they
0	appeared
0	to
0	be
0	a
0	quite
0	different
0	nation
0	.

0	He
0	told
0	us
0	,
0	that
0	his
0	residence
0	was
0	on
0	the
0	coast
0	,
0	off
0	which
0	he
0	had
0	received
0	a
0	note
0	in
0	a
0	little
0	box
0	,
0	and
0	that
0	he
0	was
0	the
0	person
0	who
0	wrote
0	that
0	note
0	and
0	sent
0	it
0	.

0	On
0	the
0	31st
0	saw
0	land
0	very
0	high
0	,
0	from
0	W.
0	half
0	N.
0	to
0	N.
0	W.
0	at
0	a
0	great
0	distance
0	.

0	that
0	this
0	sea
0	therefore
0	sometimes
0	freezes
0	to
0	such
0	a
0	degree
0	,
0	that
0	its
0	whole
0	surface
0	is
0	congealed
0	,
0	to
0	a
0	considerable
0	thickness
0	;

0	The
0	same
0	evening
0	a
0	quarrel
0	happened
0	between
0	a
0	party
0	of
0	our
0	sailors
0	,
0	on
0	shore
0	with
0	leave
0	,
0	and
0	some
0	of
0	the
0	town
0	's
0	people
0	,
0	in
0	which
0	several
0	were
0	dangerously
0	wounded
0	on
0	both
0	sides
0	;

0	On
0	the
0	5th
0	,
0	we
0	came
0	to
0	in
0	twelve
0	fathom
0	water
0	,
0	under
0	the
0	lee
0	of
0	a
0	small
0	but
0	high
0	island
0	,
0	in
0	lat
0	.

0	the
0	white
0	eagle
0	;

0	All
0	hands
0	were
0	next
0	set
0	to
0	their
0	different
0	employments
0	,
0	some
0	to
0	wood
0	and
0	water
0	,
0	and
0	some
0	to
0	compleat
0	the
0	repairs
0	.

0	On
0	the
0	21st
0	the
0	boats
0	were
0	again
0	sent
0	out
0	,
0	but
0	to
0	as
0	little
0	purpose
0	as
0	before
0	.

0	and
0	therefore
0	whenever
0	they
0	see
0	one
0	,
0	they
0	kill
0	it
0	,
0	and
0	cut
0	it
0	into
0	small
0	pieces
0	,
0	that
0	it
0	may
0	not
0	carry
0	back
0	any
0	intelligence
0	to
0	their
0	hurt
0	.

0	On
0	board
0	,
0	the
0	carpenters
0	were
0	busy
0	in
0	stripping
0	the
0	ships
0	bows
0	,
0	where
0	they
0	found
0	the
0	leak
0	of
0	the
0	Resolution
0	to
0	have
0	been
0	chiefly
0	seated
0	.

0	While
0	the
0	crews
0	were
0	pursuing
0	their
0	sport
0	,
0	two
0	canoes
0	approached
0	the
0	ships
0	,
0	with
0	more
0	than
0	forty
0	strangers
0	,
0	who
0	were
0	differently
0	clothed
0	from
0	those
0	Indians
0	we
0	had
0	hitherto
0	seen
0	in
0	this
0	latitude
0	.

0	At
0	seven
0	we
0	wore
0	ship
0	,
0	and
0	again
0	stood
0	to
0	the
0	N.
0	W.
0	At
0	ten
0	saw
0	breakers
0	from
0	N.
0	E.
0	by
0	E.
0	to
0	W.
0	by
0	S.
0	the
0	nearest
0	distant
0	about
0	a
0	mile
0	.

0	On
0	the
0	17th
0	our
0	boats
0	were
0	employed
0	in
0	towing
0	the
0	ships
0	into
0	harbour
0	in
0	sight
0	of
0	the
0	greatest
0	multitude
0	of
0	Indian
0	spectators
0	in
0	canoes
0	and
0	on
0	shore
0	,
0	that
0	we
0	had
0	ever
0	seen
0	assembled
0	together
0	in
0	any
0	part
0	of
0	our
0	voyage
0	.

0	they
0	had
0	dried
0	venison
0	,
0	dried
0	salmon
0	,
0	and
0	great
0	variety
0	of
0	other
0	fish
0	,
0	dressed
0	after
0	the
0	Russian
0	manner
0	;

0	and
0	it
0	was
0	with
0	the
0	utmost
0	difficulty
0	that
0	he
0	was
0	carried
0	to
0	the
0	nearest
0	boat
0	.

0	In
0	an
0	instant
0	a
0	number
0	of
0	their
0	fighting
0	men
0	broke
0	from
0	the
0	crowd
0	,
0	and
0	with
0	clubs
0	and
0	stones
0	rushed
0	in
0	upon
0	the
0	guard
0	,
0	four
0	of
0	whom
0	were
0	presently
0	dispatched
0	.

0	but
0	as
0	I
0	have
0	been
0	twice
0	up
0	to
0	this
0	hill
0	,
0	I
0	rather
0	think
0	the
0	distance
0	in
0	the
0	map
0	to
0	be
0	too
0	great
0	;

0	Thus
0	we
0	have
0	again
0	a
0	new
0	cause
0	of
0	the
0	phosphoreal
0	light
0	.

0	Long
0	.

0	E.
0	On
0	the
0	26th
0	we
0	changed
0	our
0	course
0	E.
0	N.
0	E.
0	and
0	finding
0	the
0	sea
0	covered
0	with
0	gulls
0	and
0	shags
0	,
0	we
0	sounded
0	,
0	but
0	found
0	no
0	ground
0	at
0	120
0	fathom
0	.

0	within
0	sight
0	of
0	land
0	,
0	yet
0	unable
0	to
0	reach
0	it
0	;

0	we
0	therefore
0	stood
0	off
0	and
0	on
0	till
0	The
0	20th
0	,
0	when
0	we
0	bore
0	away
0	for
0	the
0	land
0	to
0	leeward
0	,
0	but
0	not
0	then
0	in

0	.

0	The
0	Discovery
0	,
0	on
0	being
0	examined
0	,
0	was
0	found
0	to
0	be
0	in
0	a
0	most
0	wretched
0	condition
0	;

0	They
0	have
0	birds
0	of

0	kinds
0	in
0	great
0	abundance
0	.

0	E.
0	distant
0	six

0	On
0	the
0	25th
0	,
0	the
0	wind
0	came
0	again
0	to
0	the
0	Eastward
0	,
0	and
0	continued
0	against
0	us
0	most
0	of
0	our
0	passage
0	.

0	On
0	the
0	15th
0	lost
0	sight
0	of
0	the

0	;

0	When
0	the
0	Resolution
0	was
0	forced
0	to
0	sea
0	she
0	had
0	but
0	half
0	her
0	complement
0	of
0	water
0	;

0	About
0	ten
0	we
0	bore
0	away

0	the

0	In

0	we
0	tacked

0	the
0	Southward
0	.

0	In
0	the
0	morning
0	of

0	On

0	At
