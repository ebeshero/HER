0	THE
0	globe
0	of
0	the
0	earth
0	contains
0	,
0	as
0	far
0	as
0	we
0	know
0	,
0	three
0	large
0	masses
0	of
0	land
0	.

0	In
0	the
0	Eastern
0	hemisphere
0	we
0	find
0	first
0	that
0	mass
0	,
0	which
0	is
0	commonly
0	called
0	the
0	Old
0	World
0	,
0	and
0	which
0	comprehends
0	three
0	large
0	parts
0	,
0	bearing
0	the
0	appellation
0	of
0	Continents
0	,
0	and
0	distinguished
0	by
0	the
0	names
0	of
0	Europe
0	,
0	Asia
0	,
0	and
0	Africa
0	.

0	The
0	next
0	in
0	size
0	,
0	and
0	in
0	the
0	order
0	of
0	time
0	,
0	when
0	it
0	was
0	made
0	known
0	to
0	European
0	nations
0	,
0	is
0	situated
0	in
0	the
0	Western
0	hemisphere
0	,
0	and
0	called
0	America
0	.

0	The
0	third
0	large
0	mass
0	of
0	land
0	lies
0	in
0	the
0	South-East
0	part
0	of
0	our
0	hemisphere
0	,
0	and
0	its
0	Eastern
0	limits
0	have
0	been
0	but
0	lately
0	ascertained
0	by
0	that
0	indefatigable
0	and
0	intelligent
0	navigator
0	,
0	Capt.
0	Cook
0	,
0	in
0	the
0	year
0	1770
0	.

0	Its
0	Western
0	and
0	Northern
0	limits
0	were
0	first
0	discovered
0	in
0	1616
0	and
0	the
0	following
0	years
0	,
0	by
0	the
0	Dutch
0	navigators
0	,
0	when
0	a
0	noble
0	spirit
0	of
0	discovery
0	still
0	animated
0	the
0	governors
0	of
0	their
0	Indian
0	settlements
0	.

0	Since
0	that
0	time
0	it
0	has
0	been
0	visited
0	,
0	and
0	severally
0	seen
0	,
0	by
0	Dutch
0	and
0	English
0	navigators
0	,
0	and
0	the
0	whole
0	was
0	called
0	in
0	1644
0	New-Holland
0	,
0	from
0	its
0	first
0	discoverers
0	.

0	Perhaps
0	many
0	will
0	dissent
0	from
0	me
0	,
0	and
0	refuse
0	to
0	call
0	it
0	a
0	Continent
0	,
0	though
0	it
0	be
0	little
0	,
0	if
0	at
0	all
0	,
0	inferior
0	to
0	Europe
0	,
0	to
0	which
0	no
0	one
0	has
0	hitherto
0	hesitated
0	to
0	give
0	that
0	name
0	.

0	It
0	must
0	be
0	allowed
0	,
0	that
0	New-Holland
0	is
0	at
0	present
0	the
0	most
0	backward
0	of
0	all
0	the
0	lands
0	called
0	Continents
0	,
0	in
0	point
0	of
0	population
0	,
0	and
0	utility
0	to
0	Europe
0	;

0	but
0	this
0	objection
0	is
0	of
0	little
0	weight
0	,
0	since
0	it
0	may
0	perhaps
0	,
0	in
0	future
0	ages
0	,
0	become
0	as
0	populous
0	as
0	any
0	of
0	the
0	other
0	continents
0	,
0	and
0	equally
0	useful
0	;

0	as
0	I
0	believe
0	it
0	to
0	be
0	very
0	likely
0	to
0	supply
0	the
0	wants
0	of
0	European
0	colonies
0	.

0	We
0	know
0	this
0	land
0	but
0	imperfectly
0	,
0	and
0	all
0	our
0	navigators
0	seem
0	to
0	complain
0	that
0	it
0	is
0	deficient
0	in
0	fresh
0	water
0	and
0	large
0	rivers
0	;

0	but
0	,
0	had
0	they
0	properly
0	and
0	carefully
0	examined
0	its
0	circuit
0	,
0	especially
0	its
0	South-Western
0	shores
0	,
0	their
0	enquiries
0	would
0	perhaps
0	have
0	been
0	rewarded
0	with
0	success
0	;

0	for
0	it
0	is
0	highly
0	probable
0	,
0	that
0	a
0	land
0	of
0	so
0	great
0	extent
0	contains
0	high
0	mountains
0	in
0	its
0	interior
0	parts
0	;

0	and
0	wherever
0	those
0	are
0	,
0	there
0	must
0	be
0	rivers
0	.

0	These
0	would
0	invite
0	European
0	settlers
0	;

0	especially
0	such
0	as
0	would
0	be
0	willing
0	to
0	withdraw
0	themselves
0	from
0	the
0	oppressions
0	of
0	growing
0	despotism
0	in
0	Europe.1
0	To
0	such
0	sons
0	of
0	liberty
0	this
0	continent
0	would
0	offer
0	a
0	new
0	and
0	happy
0	asylum
0	:
0	by
0	which
0	means
0	it
0	might
0	become
0	the
0	seat
0	of
0	sciences
0	and
0	arts
0	;

0	happy
0	in
0	its
0	cultivation
0	,
0	the
0	riches
0	of
0	its
0	productions
0	,
0	and
0	the
0	number
0	of
0	its
0	inhabitants
0	.

0	The
0	rest
0	of
0	the
0	lands
0	,
0	not
0	comprehended
0	under
0	those
0	now
0	enumerated
0	,
0	are
0	only
0	islands
0	.

0	In
0	our
0	voyage
0	we
0	touched
0	at
0	the
0	Cape
0	of
0	Good
0	Hope
0	in
0	Africa
0	:
0	we
0	saw
0	only
0	the
0	last
0	fragments
0	of
0	America
0	along
0	the
0	coast
0	of
0	Tierra
0	del
0	Fuego
0	,
0	and
0	besides
0	these
0	,
0	our
0	own
0	continent
0	from
0	which
0	we
0	came
0	,
0	and
0	to
0	which
0	we
0	again
0	returned
0	.

0	We
0	have
0	therefore
0	nothing
0	to
0	say
0	in
0	particular
0	relative
0	to
0	large
0	lands
0	,
0	if
0	we
0	except
0	a
0	single
0	remark
0	,
0	which
0	we
0	collected
0	from
0	the
0	accounts
0	of
0	our
0	friends
0	on
0	board
0	the
0	Adventure
0	,
0	who
0	saw
0	part
0	of
0	New-Holland
0	in
0	1773
0	.

0	The
0	Southernmost
0	extremity
0	of
0	this
0	continent
0	has
0	a
0	great
0	familiarity
0	to
0	all
0	the
0	Southern
0	points
0	and
0	extremities
0	of
0	continents
0	,
0	and
0	therefore
0	appears
0	black
0	,
0	rocky
0	,
0	and
0	of
0	considerable
0	elevation
0	;
0	*

0	though
0	farther
0	to
0	the
0	North
0	,
0	the
0	country
0	is
0	even
0	,
0	and
0	without
0	any
0	remarkably
0	high
0	hills
0	,
0	at
0	least
0	near
0	the
0	shores
0	.

0	I
0	pretend
0	not
0	to
0	defend
0	any
0	particular
0	hypothesis
0	relative
0	to
0	the
0	theory
0	of
0	the
0	earth
0	;

0	but
0	,
0	if
0	we
0	cast
0	our
0	eyes
0	on
0	the
0	two
0	hemispheres
0	of
0	our
0	globe
0	,
0	such
0	as
0	they
0	are
0	known
0	since
0	our
0	last
0	voyage
0	,
0	they
0	seem
0	to
0	offer
0	some
0	curious
0	particulars
0	to
0	our
0	view
0	.

0	All
0	the
0	remarkable
0	Southern
0	points
0	of
0	lands
0	on
0	our
0	globe
0	,
0	have
0	a
0	great
0	and
0	striking
0	similarity
0	in
0	regard
0	to
0	their
0	conformation
0	,
0	and
0	the
0	situation
0	of
0	islands
0	in
0	their
0	vicinity
0	.

0	They
0	are
0	all
0	high
0	and
0	rocky
0	;

0	each
0	seems
0	to
0	be
0	the
0	extremity
0	of
0	a
0	range
0	of
0	high
0	mountains
0	running
0	northward
0	.

0	All
0	have
0	to
0	the
0	Eastward
0	one
0	or
0	more
0	large
0	islands
0	.

0	Nay
0	,
0	if
0	we
0	continue
0	the
0	comparison
0	,
0	all
0	continents
0	have
0	a
0	great
0	sinuosity
0	on
0	the
0	West-side
0	towards
0	the
0	north
0	.

0	So
0	many
0	coinciding
0	circumstances
0	seem
0	,
0	not
0	to
0	be
0	merely
0	accidental
0	,
0	but
0	rather
0	to
0	proceed
0	from
0	one
0	and
0	the
0	same
0	general
0	cause
0	.

0	I
0	do
0	not
0	pretend
0	to
0	point
0	out
0	this
0	first
0	cause
0	,
0	but
0	cannot
0	help
0	suspecting
0	,
0	that
0	a
0	violent
0	flood
0	coming
0	from
0	the
0	South-West
0	has
0	produced
0	this
0	striking
0	identity
0	of
0	conformation
0	in
0	these
0	lands
0	,
0	though
0	I
0	can
0	neither
0	point
0	out
0	the
0	time
0	when
0	this
0	great
0	revolution
0	happened
0	,
0	nor
0	assign
0	any
0	reason
0	for
0	its
0	operating
0	in
0	this
0	manner
0	.

0	It
0	suffices
0	to
0	have
0	mentioned
0	the
0	fact
0	,
0	and
0	hinted
0	at
0	the
0	next
0	cause
0	,
0	without
0	any
0	ostentation
0	.

0	America
0	has
0	the
0	Andes
0	running
0	from
0	the
0	South
0	to
0	the
0	North
0	,
0	and
0	ending
0	in
0	Cape
0	Froward
0	,
0	nay
0	,
0	extending
0	even
0	beyond
0	the
0	streight
0	to
0	Cape
0	Horn
0	.

0	The
0	sinuosity
0	on
0	its
0	West-side
0	is
0	evident
0	about
0	the
0	tropic
0	of
0	Capricorn
0	,
0	and
0	to
0	the
0	East
0	of
0	its
0	South-point
0	are
0	Tierra
0	del
0	Fuego
0	,
0	Staten
0	Land
0	,
0	and
0	the
0	Falkland
0	Islands
0	.

0	Africa
0	,
0	on
0	its
0	West
0	coast
0	,
0	has
0	a
0	great
0	sinuosity
0	to
0	the
0	North
0	of
0	the
0	Line
0	.

0	The
0	high
0	rocks
0	of
0	its
0	Southern
0	extremity
0	at
0	the
0	Cape
0	of
0	Good
0	Hope
0	are
0	continued
0	by
0	a
0	long
0	range
0	of
0	high
0	mountains
0	running
0	in
0	the
0	direction
0	of
0	North
0	East
0	from
0	the
0	Cape
0	.

0	Madagascar
0	,
0	and
0	several
0	small
0	islands
0	,
0	are
0	to
0	the
0	East
0	or
0	North-East
0	of
0	its
0	Southern
0	extremity
0	.

0	Asia
0	terminates
0	at
0	Cape
0	Comorin
0	in
0	a
0	high
0	,
0	rocky
0	point
0	,
0	formed
0	by
0	the
0	extremity
0	of
0	a
0	chain
0	of
0	the
0	mountains
0	of
0	Gatte
0	:
0	beyond
0	Cambaya
0	,
0	towards
0	the
0	river
0	Sind
0	,
0	there
0	is
0	a
0	sinuosity
0	similar
0	to
0	those
0	already
0	mentioned
0	;

0	and
0	on
0	the
0	East-side
0	of
0	Cape
0	Comorin
0	is
0	the
0	island
0	of
0	Ceylon
0	.

0	New-Holland
0	has
0	a
0	high
0	rocky
0	point
0	on
0	its
0	Southern
0	extremity
0	,
0	which
0	,
0	according
0	to
0	the
0	accounts
0	of
0	Tasman
0	and
0	our
0	last
0	navigators
0	,
0	seems
0	to
0	be
0	continued
0	in
0	a
0	series
0	of
0	mountains
0	extending
0	a
0	good
0	way
0	up
0	to
0	the
0	North
0	.

0	Whosoever
0	casts
0	a
0	glance
0	on
0	Africa
0	and
0	New-Holland
0	,
0	must
0	,
0	upon
0	the
0	whole
0	,
0	be
0	struck
0	with
0	the
0	similarity
0	of
0	their
0	general
0	outlines
0	;

0	the
0	sinuosity
0	to
0	the
0	West
0	being
0	very
0	remarkable
0	in
0	both
0	:
0	and
0	Eastward
0	of
0	New-Holland
0	are
0	the
0	two
0	large
0	islands
0	,
0	which
0	form
0	New-Zeeland
0	.

0	ALL
0	the
0	islands
0	which
0	we
0	saw
0	during
0	our
0	voyage
0	are
0	either
0	situated
0	within
0	the
0	tropicks
0	,
0	or
0	in
0	the
0	temperate
0	zones
0	.

0	The
0	Tropical
0	Islands
0	may
0	be
0	again
0	divided
0	into
0	high
0	and
0	low
0	.

0	The
0	high
0	Tropical
0	Islands
0	are
0	either
0	surrounded
0	by
0	reefs
0	,
0	and
0	have
0	flats
0	near
0	the
0	sea-shore
0	,
0	or
0	they
0	are
0	without
0	reefs
0	.

0	Of
0	the
0	first
0	kind
0	are
0	O-Taheitee
0	with
0	all
0	the
0	Society
0	Isles
0	and
0	Ma√¢tea
0	,
0	the
0	higher
0	Friendly
0	Isles
0	Tongatabu
0	,
0	Eaoowe
0	,
0	Namocka
0	,
0	Turtle
0	Island
0	and
0	new
0	Caledonia
0	.

0	Amongst
0	the
0	highest
0	Tropical
0	Isles
0	without
0	a
0	reef
0	,
0	we
0	reckon
0	the
0	Marquesas
0	and
0	all
0	the
0	new
0	Hebrides
0	,
0	together
0	with

0	We

0	the

0	with
0	this

0	,
0	that

0	not

0	When

0	came
0	to
0	A-Namocka
0	in
0	the
0	year
0	1774
0	,
0	we
0	saw
0	on
0	the
0	isle
0	of
0	Tofo√≤a
0	a
0	smoke
0	in
0	the
0	morning
0	,
0	which
0	appeared
0	fiery
0	at
0	night
0	.

0	When
0	we
0	passed
0	between
0	it
0	and
0	O-Gh√†o
0	,
0	we
0	observed
0	great
0	clouds
0	of
0	smoke
0	rising
0	from
0	the
0	middle
0	of
0	the
0	isle

0	attended
0	with
0	a
0	smell
0	similar
0	to
0	that
0	produced
0	by
0	burnt
0	turf
0	;

0	some
0	particles
0	filled
0	the
0	atmosphere
0	,
0	and
0	fell
0	down
0	on
0	the

0	,
0	and
0	coming
0	in
0	contact
0	with
0	the
0	eye
0	,
0	occasioned
0	an
0	acute
0	pain
0	.

0	On
0	the
0	North
0	side
0	of
0	the
0	isle
0	we
0	saw
0	a
0	large
0	place
0	with
0	the
0	evident
0	appearance
0	of
0	being
0	lately
0	burnt
0	by

0	.

0	On
0	the
0	shores
0	of
0	A-Namocka
0	,
0	pumice-stones

0	thrown

0	.

0	The
0	natives
0	of
0	all
0	these

0	Among
0	the
0	fishing
0	implements
0	of
0	these
0	islanders
0	,
0	we
0	found
0	conic
0	pieces
0	of
0	calcareous
0	stone
0	;

0	but
0	we
0	could
0	not
0	determine
0	whether
0	they
0	were
0	made
0	of
0	spar
0	,
0	or
0	of
0	coral-rock
0	:
0	though
0	I
0	am
0	inclined
0	to
0	believe
0	these
0	cones
0	to
0	be
0	a

0	of
0	sparry
0	substance
0	.

0	The
0	soil
0	of
0	the
0	New-hebrides
0	seems
0	to
0	be
0	very
0	much
0	of
0	the

0	In
0	a

0	From

0	that

0	are
0	no

0	but
0	the

0	are
0	the
0	most

0	and
0	the

0	may
0	be
0	formed
0	of

0	as

0	stay
0	,
0	and
0	the

0	After

0	,
0	from

0	,
0	it

0	it

0	Mount

0	latitude
0	:
0	but
0	,
0	as
0	we
0	constantly
0	found
0	,
0	that
0	in
0	Southern
0	latitudes
0	the
0	cold
0	is
0	much
0	more

0	than
0	in
0	the
0	corresponding
0	degrees
0	of

0	,
0	I
0	will

0	of
0	Mount
0	Egmont
0	equal
0	to
0	that
0	of

0	,
0	and

0	the

0	to

0	at
0	the

0	and
0	,
0	as

0	seemed
0	to
0	occupy
0	one
0	third
0	of
0	its

0	,
0	the

0	,
0	or

0	,
0	which
0	is

0	Dr.

0	The

0	of
0	the

0	mountains
0	,
0	in
0	the
0	interior
0	parts
0	of
0	New-Zeeland
0	,
0	both
0	in
0	Queen
0	Charlotte
0	's
0	Sound
0	and
0	in
0	Dusky

0	we

0	constantly
0	covered
0	a
0	good
0	way
0	down
0	with
0	eternal
0	snow
0	.

0	We
0	observed
0	these
0	snow
0	capt
0	heads
0	all
0	the
0	way
0	along
0	,
0	when
0	we
0	sailed
0	from
0	Dusky
0	Bay
0	to
0	Queen
0	Charlotte
0	's
0	Sound
0	in
0	May
0	,
0	in
0	the
0	year
0	1773
0	,
0	and
0	we
0	took
0	notice
0	of
0	the
0	same
0	circumstance
0	in
0	the
0	same
0	year
0	in
0	October
0	,
0	on
0	the
0	other
0	side
0	of
0	the
0	Southern
0	isle
0	,
0	when
0	contrary
0	storms
0	brought
0	us
0	a
0	good
0	way
0	along
0	its
0	South
0	East
0	shore
0	,
0	almost
0	as
0	far
0	as
0	Banks
0	's
0	Island
0	.

0	This
0	I
0	believe
0	,
0	sufficiently
0	proves
0	,
0	that
0	these
0	mountains
0	form
0	,
0	as
0	it
0	were
0	,
0	one
0	continued
0	chain
0	,
0	running
0	throughout
0	the
0	whole
0	Southern
0	Isle
0	,
0	and
0	that
0	they
0	are
0	little
0	inferior
0	in
0	height
0	to
0	twelve
0	or
0	fourteen
0	thousand
0	feet
0	.

0	This
0	long
0	series
0	of
0	mountains
0	,
0	running
0	in
0	the
0	same
0	direction
0	,
0	gives
0	room
0	for
0	a
0	probable
0	conjecture
0	,
0	that
0	the
0	metallic
0	veins
0	,
0	which
0	in
0	all
0	likelihood
0	are
0	to
0	be
0	met
0	within
0	the
0	mountains
0	of
0	New
0	Zeeland
0	,
0	are
0	of
0	a
0	very
0	rich
0	and
0	valuable
0	nature
0	.

0	The
0	hills
0	of
0	Tierra
0	del
0	Fuego
0	,
0	Staten
0	Land
0	,
0	South
0	Georgia
0	,
0	and
0	Sandwich
0	Land
0	are
0	constantly
0	covered
0	with
0	snow
0	;

0	however
0	,
0	in
0	the
0	two
0	first
0	only
0	the
0	summits
0	of
0	the
0	hills
0	had
0	snow
0	,
0	but
0	in
0	the
0	latter
0	the
0	snow
0	and
0	ice
0	reached
0	in
0	most
0	places
0	to
0	the
0	very
0	edge
0	of
0	the
0	sea
0	,
0	in
0	the
0	midst
0	of
0	their
0	summer
0	;

0	which
0	certainly
0	proves
0	the
0	extreme
0	rigour
0	of
0	the
0	climate
0	,
0	as
0	the
0	line
0	of
0	eternal
0	snow
0	comes
0	down
0	so
0	low
0	.

0	What
0	is
0	still
0	more
0	remarkable
0	,
0	this
0	happened
0	in
0	isles
0	surrounded
0	by
0	the
0	moist
0	and
0	therefore
0	mild
0	sea
0	air
0	,
0	which
0	undoubtedly
0	weakens
0	the
0	intenseness
0	of
0	the
0	frost
0	,
0	and
0	commonly
0	mitigates
0	the
0	rigour
0	of
0	the
0	climate
0	.

0	The
0	mountain
0	in
0	the
0	middle
0	of
0	the
0	great
0	peninsula
0	of
0	O-Taheitee
0	or
0	of
0	Tobreonoo
0	,
0	is
0	as
0	far
0	as
0	I
0	can
0	form
0	any
0	idea
0	,
0	the
0	highest
0	of
0	all
0	the
0	mountains
0	in
0	the
0	Tropical
0	Isles
0	:
0	it
0	is
0	in
0	some
0	places
0	of
0	an
0	easy
0	and
0	gentle
0	slope
0	,
0	and
0	intersected
0	by
0	numerous
0	and
0	very
0	deep
0	valleys
0	,
0	converging
0	towards
0	the
0	middle
0	of
0	the
0	isle
0	,
0	where
0	its
0	summits
0	are
0	to
0	be
0	met
0	with
0	.

0	The
0	highest
0	point
0	of
0	this
0	hill
0	is
0	at
0	a
0	very
0	just
0	estimate
0	,
0	about
0	seven
0	miles
0	from
0	Point
0	Venus
0	.

0	According
0	to
0	Captain
0	Cook
0	's
0	map
0	,
0	it
0	seems
0	to
0	be
0	nine
0	miles
0	distant
0	from
0	thence
0	;

0	but
0	as
0	I
0	have
0	been
0	twice
0	up
0	to
0	this
0	hill
0	,
0	I
0	rather
0	think
0	the
0	distance
0	in
0	the

0	:
0	secondly
0	the
0	nearer
0	to
0	the
0	general
0	level
0	of
0	the
0	earth
0	,
0	the
0	more
0	is
0	the

0	heated
0	,
0	probably
0	the

0	reflected
0	from
0	the

0	the

0	,
0	and
0	crossing
0	one
0	another
0	in

0	;

0	and
0	moreover
0	the

0	with
0	vapours
0	near
0	the

0	,
0	when
0	once
0	warmed
0	to

0	=

0	The
0	contrary
0	must
0	take
0	place
0	in
0	a
0	situation
0	more
0	remote
0	from
0	the
0	common
0	level
0	of
0	the

0	,
0	where
0	the

0	thinner
0	and
0	less
0	capable
0	of
0	retaining
0	the

0	.

0	These
0	two
0	principles

0	contribute

0	Under

0	,
0	the

0	of
0	the
0	earth
0	is
0	more
0	heated
0	than
0	towards
0	the
0	poles
0	,
0	because
0	the
0	sun
0	operates
0	at
0	the
0	first
0	place
0	more
0	vertically
0	,
0	and
0	at
0	the
0	other
0	more
0	obliquely
0	,
0	and
0	therefore
0	less
0	effectually
0	:
0	the
0	hills
0	being
0	under
0	the
0	line
0	in
0	a
0	more
0	heated
0	atmosphere
0	,
0	the
0	line
0	of
0	eternal
0	snow
0	,
0	is
0	there
0	naturally
0	more
0	removed
0	from
0	the
0	common
0	level
0	of
0	the
0	earth
0	,
0	than
0	towards
0	the

0	,
0	where
0	the

0	is
0	neither
0	so
0	intensely
0	nor
0	so
0	constantly
0	heated
0	,
0	which
0	consequently
0	brings
0	the
0	line
0	of

0	much
0	lower
0	.

0	The
0	atmosphere
0	being
0	a

0	As
0	the
0	power
0	of
0	gravity
0	near
0	the
0	equinoctial
0	line
0	is
0	known
0	to
0	be
0	less
0	than
0	towards
0	the
0	poles
0	,
0	the
0	atmosphere
0	naturally
0	must
0	be
0	less
0	attracted
0	between
0	the
0	tropicks
0	than
0	beyond
0	them
0	;

0	and
0	consequently
0	being
0	besides
0	more
0	heated
0	and
0	therefore
0	more
0	rarefied
0	,
0	it
0	must
0	extend
0	to
0	a
0	greater
0	height
0	between
0	the
0	tropicks
0	;

0	and
0	probably
0	this
0	may
0	contribute
0	,
0	with
0	the
0	before
0	mentioned
0	causes
0	,
0	towards
0	removing
0	there
0	the
0	line
0	of
0	eternal
0	snow
0	to
0	a

0	I

0	This

0	Every

0	a

0	The

0	Under

0	the

0	In

0	the

0	it
0	in
0	the
0	hot
0	well
0	,
0	so
0	that
0	the
0	whole
0	bulb
0	and
0	tube
0	were
0	covered
0	,
0	the
0	quicksilver
0	rose
0	soon
0	to
0	191
0	¬∞
0	,
0	but
0	after
0	having
0	been
0	for
0	five
0	minutes
0	in
0	the
0	well
0	,
0	it
0	did
0	not
0	rise
0	above
0	that
0	degree
0	.

0	I
0	took
0	the
0	thermometer
0	out
0	,
0	and
0	cleared
0	the
0	well
0	still
0	better
0	,
0	and
0	made
0	the
0	excavation
0	of
0	the
0	stone
0	below
0	deeper
0	,
0	and
0	then
0	immersed
0	it
0	again
0	during
0	ten
0	minutes
0	,
0	but
0	found
0	it
0	all
0	the
0	time
0	at
0	191
0	¬∞
0	.

0	This
0	was
0	done
0	August
0	the
0	17th
0	,
0	1774
0	,
0	at
0	4h
0	30
0	'
0	P.M.
0	at
0	high-water
0	.

0	We
0	returned
0	the
0	next
0	morning
0	about
0	nine
0	o
0	'clock
0	,
0	when
0	the
0	water
0	was
0	low
0	;

0	and
0	,
0	upon
0	immersing
0	the
0	thermometer
0	as
0	before
0	,
0	we
0	observed
0	the
0	quicksilver
0	to
0	rise
0	to
0	187
0	¬∞
0	in
0	the
0	space
0	of
0	one
0	minute
0	and
0	a
0	half
0	;

0	at
0	which
0	degree
0	it
0	remained
0	,
0	though
0	the
0	thermometer
0	continued
0	several
0	minutes
0	longer
0	in
0	the
0	water
0	.

0	I
0	threw
0	some
0	small
0	fish
0	,
0	and
0	some
0	muscles
0	,
0	into
0	the
0	hot
0	water
0	,
0	and
0	they
0	were
0	boiled
0	in
0	a
0	few
0	minutes
0	.

0	The
0	water
0	is
0	clear
0	and
0	limpid
0	,
0	and
0	has
0	no
0	peculiar
0	taste
0	,
0	except
0	that
0	I
0	thought
0	it
0	to
0	have
0	a
0	very
0	faint
0	astringency
0	.

0	I
0	put
0	a
0	piece
0	of
0	fine
0	and
0	bright
0	silver
0	into
0	it
0	,
0	which
0	having
0	lain
0	for
0	more
0	than
0	an
0	hour
0	in
0	it
0	,
0	came
0	out
0	untarnished
0	.

0	I
0	put
0	a
0	small
0	quantity
0	of
0	solution
0	of
0	salt
0	of
0	tartar
0	in
0	it
0	,
0	but
0	it
0	did
0	not
0	precipitate
0	any
0	thing
0	,
0	though
0	I
0	increased
0	the
0	quantity
0	of
0	the
0	tartar
0	.

0	I
0	had
0	no
0	other
0	substances
0	with
0	me
0	to
0	try
0	the
0	water
0	by
0	other
0	methods
0	.

0	On
0	the
0	same
0	cliff
0	,
0	but
0	close
0	to
0	the
0	sandy
0	beach
0	,
0	at
0	the
0	bottom
0	of
0	the
0	harbour
0	,
0	there
0	are
0	two
0	other
0	hot
0	springs
0	.

0	We
0	came
0	on
0	the
0	same
0	morning
0	,
0	Aug.
0	the
0	18th
0	,
0	half
0	an
0	hour
0	later
0	,
0	to
0	these
0	springs
0	.

0	I
0	hollowed
0	out
0	the
0	sand
0	to
0	gather
0	some
0	of
0	the
0	hot
0	water
0	,
0	and
0	immersed
0	my
0	thermometer
0	just
0	at
0	the
0	place
0	where
0	the
0	water
0	bubbles
0	up
0	,
0	and
0	in
0	about
0	two
0	minutes
0	time
0	the
0	quicksilver
0	rose
0	to
0	202
0	¬∞
0	,
0	and
0	remained
0	for
0	several
0	minutes
0	in
0	the
0	water
0	without
0	rising
0	higher
0	.

0	On
0	the
0	same
0	cliff
0	,
0	on
0	a
0	brow
0	about
0	60
0	or
0	80
0	fathoms
0	higher
0	,
0	we
0	found
0	a
0	place
0	clear
0	of
0	trees
0	,
0	where
0	in
0	cool
0	weather
0	,
0	especially
0	after
0	rain
0	,
0	we
0	could
0	discover
0	from
0	the
0	ship
0	,
0	steams
0	rising
0	,
0	which
0	were
0	still
0	more
0	distinctly
0	observed
0	when
0	we
0	came
0	close
0	to
0	the
0	place
0	.

0	We
0	found
0	ourselves
0	,
0	after
0	a
0	few
0	minutes
0	stay
0	,
0	in
0	a
0	profuse
0	perspiration
0	,
0	occasioned
0	by
0	the
0	hot
0	steams
0	,
0	and
0	the
0	heat
0	of
0	the
0	ground
0	we
0	stood
0	on
0	,
0	which
0	in
0	some
0	places
0	was
0	intolerable
0	.

0	When
0	the
0	volcano
0	made
0	an
0	explosion
0	,
0	we
0	always
0	saw
0	a
0	new
0	quantity
0	of
0	vapours
0	and
0	steams
0	pierce
0	these
0	spiracula
0	,
0	which
0	are
0	apparently
0	shut
0	up
0	,
0	but
0	seem
0	to
0	have
0	a
0	cavity
0	underneath
0	;

0	for
0	the
0	whole
0	mountain
0	gave
0	a
0	hollow
0	sound
0	,
0	when
0	we
0	were
0	walking
0	on
0	the
0	footpath
0	leading
0	to
0	these
0	solfataras
0	;

0	and
0	I
0	likewise
0	traced
0	a
0	train
0	of
0	these
0	spiracula
0	,
0	both
0	above
0	and
0	below
0	on
0	the
0	sides
0	of
0	this
0	hill
0	,
0	as
0	far
0	as
0	within
0	a
0	few
0	yards
0	of
0	the
0	hot
0	wells
0	.

0	I
0	saw
0	the
0	solfataras
0	three
0	times
0	.

0	The
0	second
0	time
0	I
0	took
0	my
0	thermometer
0	with
0	me
0	,
0	and
0	having
0	dug
0	a
0	hole
0	about
0	a
0	foot
0	deep
0	,
0	I
0	hung
0	the
0	thermometer
0	in
0	it
0	by
0	the
0	ribbon
0	on
0	its
0	top
0	,
0	to
0	a
0	stick
0	laid
0	across
0	the
0	hole
0	;

0	and
0	I
0	saw
0	it
0	rise
0	from
0	80
0	¬∞
0	in
0	a
0	few
0	seconds
0	to
0	170
0	¬∞
0	:
0	having
0	left
0	the
0	thermometer
0	for
0	four
0	minutes
0	in
0	the
0	hole
0	,
0	I
0	found
0	it
0	still
0	at
0	170
0	¬∞
0	,
0	and
0	though
0	I
0	repeated
0	this
0	at
0	one
0	minute
0	's
0	interval
0	,
0	three
0	times
0	,
0	the
0	mercury
0	was
0	still
0	at
0	the
0	same
0	degree
0	.

0	When
0	I
0	took
0	it
0	out
0	,
0	it
0	fell
0	in
0	a
0	second
0	's
0	time
0	to
0	160
0	¬∞
0	,
0	and
0	gradually
0	lower
0	.

0	In
0	my
0	cabin
0	on
0	board
0	the
0	ship
0	,
0	it
0	stood
0	at
0	78
0	¬∞
0	;

0	having
0	been
0	carried
0	close
0	to
0	my
0	body
0	up
0	the
0	hill
0	,
0	by
0	a
0	long
0	ascent
0	,
0	it
0	rose
0	to
0	87
0	¬∞
0	;

0	I
0	hung
0	it
0	therefore
0	in
0	the
0	open
0	air
0	,
0	in
0	the
0	shade
0	of
0	a
0	tree
0	on
0	the
0	hill
0	,
0	about
0	twenty
0	yards
0	from
0	the
0	smoking
0	place
0	,
0	for
0	about
0	five
0	minutes
0	,
0	and
0	found
0	it
0	to
0	stand
0	at
0	80
0	¬∞
0	,
0	and
0	to
0	remain
0	at
0	the
0	same
0	height
0	for
0	a
0	long
0	while
0	after
0	.

0	When
0	I
0	was
0	digging
0	the
0	hole
0	for
0	the
0	reception
0	of
0	the
0	thermometer
0	,
0	the
0	natives
0	seemed
0	uneasy
0	,
0	and
0	were
0	apprehensive
0	the
0	place
0	would
0	be
0	on
0	fire.4
0	This
0	happened
0	on
0	August
0	the
0	12th
0	at
0	about
0	ten
0	o
0	'clock
0	in
0	the
0	morning
0	.

0	I
0	went
0	up
0	again
0	on
0	August
0	the
0	14th
0	in
0	the
0	forenoon
0	,
0	and
0	repeated
0	the
0	experiment
0	with
0	this
0	difference
0	only
0	,
0	that
0	we
0	entirely
0	buried
0	the
0	thermometer
0	in
0	the
0	hole
0	,
0	by
0	putting
0	loose
0	earth
0	round
0	it
0	.

0	It
0	had
0	stood
0	that
0	day
0	in
0	my
0	cabin
0	at
0	78
0	¬∞
0	,
0	on
0	the
0	hill
0	at
0	80
0	¬∞
0	;

0	but
0	after
0	having
0	been
0	buried
0	a
0	minute
0	,
0	it
0	rose
0	to
0	210
0	¬∞
0	and
0	there
0	it
0	remained
0	stationary
0	for
0	five
0	minutes
0	.

0	As
0	I
0	could
0	trace
0	the
0	spiracula
0	of
0	hot
0	steams
0	,
0	blended
0	with
0	some
0	sulphureous
0	smell
0	,
0	all
0	along
0	the
0	side
0	of
0	the
0	hill
0	,
0	down
0	to
0	the
0	hot
0	wells
0	;

0	it
0	is
0	probable
0	,
0	that
0	a
0	stream
0	of
0	water
0	,
0	in
0	a
0	subterraneous
0	chasm
0	or
0	crevice
0	,
0	coming
0	too
0	near
0	one
0	of
0	the
0	places
0	,
0	that
0	are
0	violently
0	heated
0	by
0	the
0	neighbouring
0	volcano
0	,
0	is
0	resolved
0	into
0	steams
0	;

0	and
0	forced
0	through
0	the
0	earth
0	and
0	stones
0	;

0	parts
0	of
0	it
0	however
0	seem
0	again
0	to
0	gather
0	somewhere
0	in
0	small
0	streams
0	,
0	oozing
0	out
0	at
0	the
0	hot
0	wells
0	,
0	close
0	to
0	the
0	sea-side
0	.

0	I
0	am
0	even
0	apt
0	to
0	believe
0	,
0	that
0	this
0	chasm
0	or
0	crevice
0	is
0	connected
0	with
0	the
0	crater
0	of
0	the
0	volcano
0	:
0	for
0	on
0	August
0	the
0	11th
0	,
0	when
0	the
0	volcano
0	was
0	heard
0	making
0	great
0	explosions
0	,
0	and
0	seen
0	throwing
0	up
0	very
0	large
0	masses
0	of
0	stones
0	,
0	ignited
0	ashes
0	,
0	and
0	immense
0	clouds
0	of
0	thick
0	smoke
0	,
0	we
0	observed
0	on
0	the
0	hill
0	,
0	that
0	at
0	each
0	explosion
0	,
0	there
0	came
0	new
0	quantities
0	of
0	steam
0	through
0	the
0	spiracula
0	.

0	At
0	the
0	bottom
0	of
0	the
0	harbour
0	near
0	the
0	beach
0	,
0	is
0	a
0	small
0	pond
0	containing
0	some
0	fresh
0	and
0	palatable
0	water
0	;

0	it
0	is
0	tinged
0	somewhat
0	brownish
0	and
0	though
0	perfectly
0	good
0	when
0	fresh
0	,
0	it
0	soon
0	contracted
0	in
0	the
0	casks
0	a
0	much
0	greater
0	degree
0	of
0	putrefaction
0	and
0	foetid
0	smell
0	,
0	than
0	had
0	been
0	observed
0	of
0	any
0	other
0	water
0	during
0	the
0	while
0	voyage
0	,
0	which
0	I
0	believe
0	proves
0	that
0	some
0	foreign
0	,
0	perhaps
0	inflammable
0	particles
0	are
0	contained
0	in
0	this
0	water
0	.

0	This
0	pond
0	was
0	connected
0	,
0	within
0	the
0	bushes
0	,
0	with
0	a
0	range
0	of
0	stagnant
0	,
0	muddy
0	waters
0	,
0	for
0	more
0	than
0	a
0	mile
0	or
0	two
0	,
0	along
0	the
0	plain
0	opposite
0	the
0	harbour
0	.

0	These
0	waters
0	,
0	are
0	it
0	seems
0	gathered
0	here
0	during
0	the
0	rainy
0	season
0	;

0	and
0	as
0	they
0	have
0	no
0	visible
0	drain
0	,
0	they
0	collect
0	in
0	the
0	lowest
0	parts
0	and
0	stagnate
0	,
0	and
0	as
0	the
0	whole
0	surface
0	of
0	the
0	soil
0	of
0	the
0	isle
0	is
0	formed
0	of
0	volcanic
0	ashes
0	,
0	containing
0	all
0	more
0	or
0	less
0	saline
0	or
0	sulphureous
0	particles
0	,
0	the
0	water
0	may
0	dissolve
0	them
0	,
0	and
0	strike
0	the
0	brown
0	colour
0	by
0	extracting
0	the
0	vegetable
0	substances
0	gradually
0	falling
0	into
0	or
0	coming
0	into
0	contact
0	with
0	it
0	.

0	In
0	the
0	rest
0	of
0	the
0	isles
0	belonging
0	to
0	the
0	New
0	Hebrides
0	,
0	we
0	frequently
0	observed
0	large
0	streams
0	of
0	water
0	forming
0	cascades
0	on
0	the
0	steep
0	descents
0	of
0	hills
0	,
0	and
0	thus
0	precipitating
0	themselves
0	down
0	and
0	soon
0	mixing
0	with
0	the
0	briny
0	fluid
0	of
0	the

0	.

0	The
0	Friendly

0	In

0	New-zeeland

0	Some

0	or
0	neglected
0	,
0	as
0	might

0	and
0	plant
0	it
0	with

0	thus
0	grows

0	most
0	considerable
0	body
0	of

0	The

0	the

0	the
0	Society
0	Isles
0	,
0	this
0	rule
0	admits
0	of
0	many
0	exceptions
0	.

0	In
0	New
0	Zeeland
0	,
0	Tierra
0	del
0	Fuego
0	,
0	New
0	Caledonia
0	and
0	all
0	the
0	New
0	Hebrides
0	,
0	I
0	believe
0	the
0	rule
0	to
0	be
0	true
0	:
0	for
0	all
0	these
0	lands
0	are
0	high
0	and
0	have
0	generally
0	bold
0	coasts
0	;

0	and
0	the
0	soundings
0	are
0	deep
0	close
0	into
0	the
0	shore
0	without
0	decreasing
0	.

0	I
0	have
0	however
0	in
0	some
0	instances
0	observed
0	just
0	the
0	contrary
0	;

0	as
0	off
0	the
0	South
0	entrance
0	of
0	Dusky
0	Bay
0	we
0	had
0	about
0	45
0	fathoms
0	water
0	;

0	but
0	in
0	the
0	bay
0	itself
0	we
0	had
0	no
0	ground
0	with
0	80
0	fathom
0	line
0	.

0	Off
0	the
0	South
0	coast
0	of
0	Tierra
0	del
0	Fuego
0	between
0	Cape
0	Noir
0	and
0	Christmas
0	Bay
0	,
0	we
0	had
0	45
0	and
0	50
0	fathom
0	water
0	,
0	which
0	increased
0	to
0	60
0	or
0	70
0	;

0	but
0	when
0	we
0	stood
0	in
0	for
0	Christmas
0	Bay
0	we
0	had
0	no
0	ground
0	with
0	80
0	fathom
0	of
0	line
0	,
0	in
0	the
0	very
0	entrance
0	.

0	When
0	we
0	were
0	off
0	the
0	coast
0	of
0	South
0	Georgia
0	we
0	had
0	regular
0	soundings
0	,
0	but
0	in
0	the
0	entrance
0	of
0	Possession
0	Bay
0	we
0	had
0	no
0	ground
0	with
0	54
0	fathoms
0	.

0	According
0	to
0	the
0	above
0	rule
0	of
0	Mr.
0	de
0	Buffon
0	,
0	the
0	low
0	isles
0	in
0	the
0	South-Seas
0	should
0	have
0	gradual
0	soundings
0	;

0	but
0	we
0	found
0	the
0	contrary
0	to
0	be
0	true
0	:
0	for
0	close
0	to
0	the
0	reef
0	forming
0	these
0	isles
0	,
0	the
0	water
0	is
0	almost
0	unfathomable
0	.

0	The
0	same
0	may
0	be
0	said
0	of
0	O-Taheitee
0	and
0	all
0	the
0	Society
0	Isles
0	,
0	which
0	are
0	surrounded
0	by
0	a
0	fertile
0	plain
0	extending
0	from
0	the
0	hills
0	to
0	the
0	sea
0	,
0	and
0	then
0	included
0	in
0	a
0	reef
0	,
0	beyond
0	which
0	the
0	sea
0	immediately
0	becomes
0	excessively
0	deep
0	.

0	Near
0	Turtle-Island
0	we
0	saw
0	an
0	oblong
0	reef
0	,
0	which
0	was
0	no
0	where
0	free
0	from
0	water
0	,
0	had
0	a
0	deep
0	sea
0	included
0	,
0	and
0	on
0	its
0	outsides
0	there
0	was
0	a
0	great
0	depth
0	close
0	to
0	the
0	reef
0	.

0	All
0	these
0	instances
0	here
0	enumerated
0	,
0	seem
0	to
0	be
0	exceptions
0	to
0	Mr.
0	de
0	Buffon
0	's
0	rule
0	.

0	wherever
0	there
0	is
0	an
0	extensive
0	bank
0	or
0	shoal
0	,
0	there
0	the
0	colour
0	of
0	the
0	sea-water
0	is
0	changed
0	;

0	but
0	even
0	this
0	is
0	subject
0	to
0	many
0	exceptions
0	:
0	sometimes
0	we
0	find
0	places
0	which
0	are
0	amazingly
0	clear
0	,
0	and
0	the
0	ground
0	,
0	at
0	the
0	depth
0	of
0	several
0	fathoms
0	,
0	may
0	be
0	seen
0	as
0	plainly
0	as
0	if
0	it
0	were
0	within
0	a
0	few
0	yards
0	of
0	the
0	surface
0	;

0	sometimes
0	the
0	sea
0	assumes
0	a
0	grey
0	hue
0	,
0	and
0	seems
0	turbid
0	,
0	as
0	if
0	it
0	had
0	lost
0	its
0	limpidity
0	.

0	But
0	often
0	you
0	are
0	deceived
0	by
0	the
0	situation
0	of
0	the
0	sky
0	and
0	clouds
0	.

0	Dark
0	,
0	cloudy
0	weather
0	involves
0	likewise
0	the
0	whole
0	ocean
0	in
0	a
0	grey
0	hue
0	.

0	A
0	serene
0	and
0	clear
0	sky
0	tinges
0	the
0	waves
0	with
0	the
0	finest
0	berylline
0	or
0	blueish-green
0	colour
0	.

0	If
0	a
0	cloud
0	appears
0	,
0	it
0	gives
0	to
0	a
0	spot
0	of
0	the
0	sea
0	a
0	hue
0	quite
0	different
0	from
0	the
0	rest
0	;

0	and
0	,
0	if
0	not
0	well
0	attended
0	to
0	,
0	often
0	alarms
0	the
0	navigator
0	with
0	the
0	fear
0	of
0	soundings
0	,
0	or
0	even
0	shoals
0	.

0	A
0	judicious
0	eye
0	,
0	conducted
0	by
0	long
0	experience
0	,
0	can
0	alone
0	distinguish
0	properly
0	in
0	these
0	cases
0	.

0	But
0	,
0	upon
0	the
0	whole
0	,
0	it
0	cannot
0	be
0	too
0	much
0	recommended
0	to
0	navigators
0	,
0	especially
0	in
0	unexplored
0	seas
0	,
0	to
0	make
0	use
0	of
0	the
0	lead
0	in
0	every
0	doubtful
0	situation
0	.
0	*

0	It
0	has
0	been
0	suspected
0	,
0	that
0	the
0	saltness
0	of
0	the
0	ocean
0	is
0	not
0	every
0	where
0	equal
0	.

0	Some
0	assert
0	the
0	sea
0	to
0	be
0	salter
0	under
0	the
0	Line
0	than
0	towards
0	the
0	Poles
0	;
0	=

0	that
0	the
0	great
0	oceans
0	are
0	salter
0	than
0	the
0	smaller
0	seas
0	,
0	which
0	are
0	almost
0	included
0	by
0	land
0	,
0	viz.
0	the
0	Baltic
0	,
0	the
0	Mediterranean
0	,
0	the
0	White
0	Sea
0	near
0	Archangel
0	,
0	the
0	Persian
0	and
0	the
0	Arabic
0	Gulphs
0	,
0	etc
0	.
0	;

0	that
0	its
0	saltness
0	increases
0	with
0	its
0	large
0	depth
0	;

0	and
0	lastly
0	,
0	that
0	the
0	high
0	sea
0	,
0	at
0	a
0	great
0	distance
0	from
0	land
0	,
0	is
0	salter
0	than
0	near
0	it
0	,
0	and
0	especially
0	near
0	places
0	where
0	large
0	rivers
0	fall
0	into
0	the
0	sea
0	.

0	I
0	had
0	no
0	opportunity
0	to
0	make
0	the
0	necessary
0	experiments
0	to
0	ascertain
0	or
0	to
0	refute
0	these
0	assertions
0	,
0	as
0	I
0	was
0	obliged
0	to
0	set
0	out
0	upon
0	this
0	expedition
0	almost
0	at
0	a
0	moment
0	's
0	warning
0	,
0	and
0	could
0	not
0	therefore
0	provide
0	any
0	apparatus
0	necessary
0	for
0	that
0	purpose
0	.

0	The
0	above
0	remarks
0	may
0	,
0	however
0	,
0	serve
0	to
0	future
0	navigators
0	,
0	as
0	a
0	hint
0	of
0	what
0	is
0	still
0	wanted
0	to
0	be
0	observed
0	,
0	relative
0	to
0	the
0	saltness
0	of
0	the
0	ocean
0	.

0	I
0	should
0	therefore
0	propose
0	to
0	them
0	,
0	to
0	procure
0	the
0	apparatus
0	described
0	by
0	Mr.
0	Wilke
0	,
0	in
0	the
0	Memoirs
0	of
0	the
0	Swedish
0	Academy

0	33

0	6
0	of
0	the
0	1st
0	quarter
0	,
0	which
0	serves
0	to
0	bring
0	the
0	water
0	of
0	the
0	ocean
0	up
0	from
0	any
0	given
0	depth
0	:
0	they
0	ought
0	also
0	to
0	be
0	provided
0	with
0	an
0	accurate
0	and
0	nice
0	hydrostatical
0	balance
0	,
0	in
0	order
0	to
0	ascertain
0	the
0	specific
0	gravity
0	of
0	any
0	water
0	or
0	liquid
0	;

0	or
0	they
0	may
0	make
0	use
0	,
0	for
0	convenience
0	sake
0	,
0	of
0	a
0	haloscopium
0	,
0	consisting
0	of
0	a
0	hollow
0	globe
0	of
0	ivory
0	,
0	into
0	which
0	a
0	tube
0	of
0	about
0	five
0	or
0	six
0	inches
0	must
0	be
0	inserted
0	,
0	on
0	which
0	the
0	different
0	specific
0	weights
0	of
0	pure
0	water
0	,
0	and
0	its
0	various
0	mixtures
0	with
0	certain
0	quantities
0	of
0	common
0	salt
0	,
0	are
0	marked
0	in
0	degrees
0	;

0	so
0	that
0	,
0	by
0	immersing
0	this
0	simple
0	machine
0	into
0	sea-water
0	,
0	it
0	would
0	be
0	easy
0	to
0	ascertain
0	the
0	degrees
0	of
0	its
0	saltness
0	.

0	This
0	machine
0	would
0	likewise
0	serve
0	to
0	ascertain
0	the
0	comparative
0	purity
0	and
0	weight
0	of
0	every
0	water
0	found
0	in
0	rivers
0	,
0	wells
0	,
0	etc.
0	etc
0	.

0	It
0	has
0	likewise
0	formerly
0	been
0	believed
0	,
0	that
0	,
0	besides
0	the
0	common
0	saltness
0	,
0	the
0	water
0	of
0	the
0	ocean
0	contained
0	particles
0	,
0	which
0	communicated
0	to
0	it
0	a
0	kind
0	of
0	bitterness
0	,
0	that
0	made
0	it
0	next
0	to
0	impossible
0	to
0	distil
0	drinkable
0	water
0	from
0	sea-water
0	.

0	The
0	ingenious
0	Dr.
0	Lind
0	,
0	3
0	of
0	Haslar-hospital
0	,
0	near
0	Portsmouth
0	,
0	has
0	long
0	ago
0	shewn
0	how
0	little
0	foundation
0	there
0	is
0	in
0	this
0	prejudice
0	,
0	and
0	likewise
0	taught
0	the
0	British
0	nation
0	,
0	without
0	any
0	public
0	reward
0	or
0	encouragement
0	,

0	method
0	for
0	obtaining
0	,
0	by
0	distillation
0	,
0	potable
0	water
0	from
0	sea-water
0	.
0	*

0	When
0	we
0	made
0	use
0	of
0	Dr.
0	Irving
0	's
0	distilling
0	machine
0	,
0	we
0	likewise
0	found
0	,
0	that
0	the
0	water
0	thus
0	distilled
0	was
0	not
0	only
0	entirely
0	freed
0	from
0	its
0	salt
0	,
0	but
0	,
0	besides
0	this
0	,
0	we
0	never
0	could
0	discover
0	the
0	least
0	bitter
0	particle
0	in
0	the
0	drinkable
0	water
0	.

0	But
0	it
0	must
0	not
0	by
0	any
0	means
0	be
0	concluded
0	from
0	hence
0	,
0	that
0	there
0	are
0	no
0	such
0	bitter
0	particles
0	contained
0	in
0	the
0	sea-water
0	,
0	for
0	everyone
0	knows
0	too
0	well
0	,
0	that
0	,
0	after
0	the
0	fresh
0	water
0	has
0	been
0	evaporated
0	from
0	sea-water
0	,
0	and
0	salt
0	has
0	been
0	thereby
0	formed
0	,
0	there
0	remains
0	always
0	a
0	thick
0	,
0	gelatinous
0	lie
0	,
0	which
0	cannot
0	be
0	crystallized
0	,
0	and
0	which
0	is
0	nothing
0	but
0	a
0	mixture
0	,
0	containing
0	marine
0	acid
0	and
0	magnesia
0	alba
0	,
0	and
0	,
0	besides
0	these
0	ingredients
0	,
0	the
0	sea-brine
0	always
0	contains
0	some
0	Glauber
0	's
0	salt
0	and
0	some
0	selenitic
0	particles
0	;

0	so
0	that
0	it
0	seems
0	as
0	if
0	the
0	whole
0	were
0	a
0	mixture
0	of
0	fresh
0	water
0	,
0	marine
0	acid
0	,
0	vitriolic
0	acid
0	,
0	fixed
0	mineral
0	alkali
0	,
0	magnesia
0	,
0	and

0	.

0	However
0	,
0	though
0	several
0	of
0	these
0	substances

0	of

0	The

0	will
0	at
0	once
0	show
0	the

0	of
0	the

0	.

0	From
0	this
0	table
0	it
0	appears
0	,
0	that
0	under
0	the
0	Line
0	,
0	and
0	near
0	the
0	Tropics
0	,
0	the
0	water

0	cooler
0	at
0	a
0	great
0	depth
0	than
0	at
0	its
0	surface
0	.

0	In
0	high
0	latitudes
0	,
0	the
0	air
0	is
0	colder
0	sometimes
0	,
0	sometimes
0	very
0	near
0	upon
0	a
0	par
0	,
0	and
0	sometimes
0	warmer
0	than
0	the
0	sea-water
0	at
0	the
0	depth
0	of
0	about
0	100
0	fathoms
0	;

0	according
0	as
0	the
0	preceding
0	changes
0	of
0	the
0	temperature
0	of
0	the
0	air
0	,
0	or
0	the

0	and
0	violence
0	of
0	the
0	wind
0	happen
0	to
0	fall
0	out
0	.

0	For
0	it
0	is
0	to
0	be
0	observed
0	,
0	that
0	these
0	experiments
0	were
0	always
0	made
0	when
0	we
0	had
0	a
0	calm
0	,
0	or
0	at
0	least
0	very
0	little
0	wind
0	;

0	because
0	,
0	in
0	a
0	gale
0	of
0	wind
0	,
0	we
0	could
0	not
0	have
0	been
0	able
0	to
0	make
0	them
0	in
0	a
0	boat
0	.

0	Another
0	probable
0	cause
0	of
0	the
0	difference
0	in
0	the
0	temperature
0	of
0	the
0	sea-water
0	,
0	in
0	the
0	same
0	high
0	latitude
0	,
0	undoubtedly
0	must
0	be
0	sought
0	in
0	the
0	ice
0	;

0	in
0	a
0	sea
0	covered
0	with
0	high
0	and
0	extensive
0	ice
0	islands
0	,
0	the
0	water
0	should
0	be
0	colder
0	than
0	in
0	a
0	sea
0	which
0	is
0	at
0	a
0	great
0	distance
0	from
0	any
0	ice
0	.

0	The
0	Phosphoreal
0	Light
0	of
0	the
0	Sea-Water
0	It
0	is
0	very
0	well
0	known
0	,
0	that
0	the
0	sea-water
0	has
0	sometimes
0	a
0	luminous
0	appearance
0	,
0	or
0	,
0	to
0	use
0	a
0	more
0	philosophical
0	word
0	,
0	a
0	phosphorical
0	light
0	.

0	Many
0	have
0	endeavoured
0	to
0	give
0	us
0	the
0	real
0	causes
0	of
0	this
0	phaenomenon
0	;
0	*

0	and
0	,
0	in
0	consequence
0	,
0	some
0	have
0	brought
0	us
0	the
0	drawing
0	of
0	a
0	curious
0	submarine
0	insect
0	,
0	related
0	to
0	the
0	shrimp
0	kind
0	,
0	which
0	had
0	a
0	peculiar
0	luminous
0	appearance
0	,
0	and
0	asserted
0	this
0	to
0	be
0	the
0	cause
0	of
0	the
0	phosphoreal
0	light
0	of
0	the
0	sea
0	.
0	=

0	Others
0	again
0	ascribe
0	it
0	to
0	the
0	great
0	number
0	of
0	animals
0	of
0	the
0	mollusca-tribe
0	,
0	swimming
0	every
0	where
0	in
0	the
0	sea
0	.

0	The
0	above-mentioned
0	shrimps
0	,
0	as
0	well
0	as
0	the
0	mollusca
0	,
0	may
0	contribute
0	to
0	make
0	the
0	sea
0	appear
0	luminous
0	;

0	but
0	I
0	would
0	not
0	venture
0	to
0	assert
0	these
0	to
0	be
0	the
0	only
0	causes
0	of
0	the
0	phosphoreal
0	light
0	,
0	after
0	the
0	observation
0	of
0	the
0	various
0	phaenomena
0	I
0	made
0	in
0	the
0	course
0	of
0	this
0	long
0	voyage
0	.

0	First
0	,
0	I
0	found
0	reason
0	to
0	doubt
0	,
0	whether
0	all
0	the
0	luminous
0	appearances
0	in
0	the
0	sea
0	are
0	of
0	the
0	same
0	nature
0	;

0	for
0	one
0	kind
0	of
0	these
0	phaenomena
0	never
0	extend
0	to
0	a
0	great
0	distance
0	from
0	the
0	ship
0	;

0	that
0	part
0	of
0	the
0	sea
0	only
0	appears
0	luminous
0	which
0	is
0	close
0	to
0	the
0	ship
0	,
0	and
0	the
0	light
0	is
0	likewise
0	communicated
0	only
0	to
0	the
0	top
0	of
0	the
0	next
0	waves
0	,
0	that
0	break
0	obliquely
0	from
0	it
0	;

0	and
0	this
0	happens
0	commonly
0	in
0	a
0	fresh
0	gale
0	.

0	Another
0	kind
0	of
0	phosphoreal
0	light
0	I
0	observed
0	commonly
0	in
0	,
0	or
0	immediately
0	succeeding
0	a
0	long
0	calm
0	,
0	after
0	hot
0	weather
0	;

0	it
0	spread
0	more
0	over
0	,
0	and
0	even
0	mixed
0	with
0	the
0	body
0	of
0	the
0	sea
0	,
0	than
0	the
0	former
0	.

0	When
0	we
0	took
0	the
0	sea-water
0	in
0	this
0	condition
0	into
0	a
0	tub
0	,
0	it
0	there
0	became
0	dark
0	as
0	soon
0	as
0	it
0	was
0	free
0	from
0	motion
0	:
0	but
0	,
0	at
0	each
0	violent
0	agitation
0	of
0	the
0	water
0	,
0	it
0	appeared
0	luminous
0	,
0	where
0	the
0	motion
0	was
0	produced
0	,
0	and
0	seemed
0	to
0	stick
0	for
0	a
0	moment
0	only
0	to
0	the
0	finger
0	or
0	hand
0	,
0	which
0	agitated
0	the
0	water
0	,
0	but
0	disappeared
0	as
0	instantaneously
0	.

0	The
0	third
0	kind
0	of
0	phosphoreal
0	light
0	is
0	no
0	doubt
0	caused
0	by
0	mollusca
0	,
0	*
0	whose
0	whole
0	figure
0	may
0	be
0	distinguished
0	in
0	the
0	water
0	by
0	their
0	own
0	luminous
0	appearance
0	.

0	I
0	have
0	observed
0	,
0	though
0	rarely
0	,
0	the
0	same
0	effect
0	to
0	be
0	occasioned
0	by
0	fish
0	and
0	shell-fish
0	;
0	=

0	and
0	there
0	may
0	be
0	likewise
0	some
0	shrimps
0	and
0	other
0	insects
0	,
0	√ó
0	that
0	are
0	phosphorescent
0	,
0	though
0	I
0	have
0	never
0	seen
0	them
0	.

0	But
0	the
0	most
0	singular
0	and
0	surprizing
0	appearance
0	of
0	this
0	nature
0	,
0	I
0	observed
0	in
0	the
0	night
0	preceding
0	Oct.
0	30
0	,
0	1772
0	,
0	when
0	we
0	were
0	off
0	the
0	Cape
0	of
0	Good
0	Hope
0	,
0	at
0	the
0	distance
0	of
0	a
0	few
0	miles
0	from
0	the
0	shore
0	,
0	and
0	had
0	a
0	fresh
0	gale
0	.

0	Scarcely
0	had
0	night
0	spread
0	its
0	veil
0	over
0	the
0	surface
0	of
0	the
0	ocean
0	,
0	when
0	it
0	had
0	the
0	apperance
0	of
0	being
0	all
0	over
0	on
0	fire
0	.

0	Every
0	wave
0	that
0	broke
0	had
0	a
0	luminous
0	margin
0	or
0	top
0	;

0	wherever
0	the
0	sides
0	of
0	the
0	ship
0	came
0	in
0	contact
0	with
0	the
0	sea
0	,
0	there
0	appeared
0	a
0	line
0	of
0	phosphoreal
0	light
0	.

0	The
0	eye
0	discovered
0	this
0	luminous
0	appearance
0	every
0	where
0	on
0	the
0	ocean
0	;

0	nay
0	,
0	the
0	very
0	bosom
0	of
0	this
0	immense
0	element
0	seemed
0	to
0	be
0	pregnant
0	with
0	this
0	shining
0	appearance
0	.

0	We
0	saw
0	great
0	bodies
0	illuminated
0	moving
0	in
0	the
0	sea
0	;

0	some
0	came
0	along-side
0	of
0	the
0	ship
0	,
0	and
0	stood
0	on
0	along
0	with
0	her
0	;

0	others
0	moved
0	off
0	from
0	her
0	with
0	a
0	velocity
0	almost
0	equal
0	to
0	lightning
0	.

0	The
0	shape
0	of
0	these
0	illuminated
0	bodies
0	discovered
0	them
0	to
0	be
0	fishes
0	.

0	Some
0	approached
0	near
0	one
0	another
0	,
0	and
0	when
0	a
0	small
0	one
0	came
0	near
0	a
0	larger
0	,
0	it
0	made
0	all
0	possible
0	haste
0	to
0	fly
0	from
0	the
0	danger
0	.

0	I
0	had
0	a
0	bucket
0	full
0	of
0	this
0	luminous
0	sea-water
0	drawn
0	up
0	for
0	examination
0	.

0	We
0	found
0	,
0	that
0	an
0	infinite
0	number
0	of
0	little
0	round
0	luminous
0	bodies
0	were
0	moving
0	in
0	the
0	water
0	with
0	amazing
0	quickness
0	.

0	After
0	the
0	water
0	had
0	been
0	standing
0	for
0	a
0	little
0	while
0	,
0	the
0	small
0	sparkling
0	objects
0	seemed
0	to
0	decrease
0	in
0	quantity
0	,
0	but
0	,
0	by
0	stirring
0	the
0	water
0	again
0	,
0	we
0	observed
0	the
0	whole
0	to
0	be
0	again
0	entirely
0	luminous
0	;

0	and
0	leaving
0	the
0	water
0	undisturbed
0	,
0	we
0	saw
0	the
0	little
0	sparks
0	moving
0	very
0	briskly
0	in
0	different
0	directions
0	.

0	Though
0	the
0	bucket
0	with
0	the
0	water
0	was
0	suspended
0	,
0	that
0	it
0	might
0	be
0	less
0	affected
0	by
0	the
0	motion
0	of
0	the
0	ship
0	,
0	the
0	sparkling
0	objects
0	still
0	moved
0	to
0	and
0	fro
0	'
0	,
0	so
0	that
0	this
0	first
0	convinced
0	me
0	,
0	that
0	these
0	luminous
0	atoms
0	had
0	a
0	voluntary
0	motion
0	,
0	quite
0	independent
0	of
0	the
0	agitation
0	of
0	the
0	water
0	or
0	ship
0	;

0	but
0	,
0	at
0	each
0	agitation
0	of
0	the
0	water
0	by
0	a
0	stick
0	or
0	the
0	hand
0	,
0	we
0	plainly
0	perceived
0	the
0	sparkling
0	to
0	increase
0	.

0	Sometimes
0	,
0	by
0	stirring
0	the
0	water
0	,
0	one
0	of
0	these
0	phosphoreal
0	sparks
0	would
0	stick
0	to
0	the
0	hand
0	or
0	finger
0	.

0	They
0	were
0	scarcely
0	of
0	the
0	size
0	of
0	the
0	smallest
0	pin
0	's
0	head
0	.

0	The
0	least
0	magnifier
0	of
0	my
0	microscope
0	discovered
0	these
0	little
0	atoms
0	to
0	be
0	globular
0	,
0	gelatinous
0	,
0	transparent
0	,
0	and
0	somewhat
0	brownish
0	.

0	By
0	putting
0	one
0	under
0	the
0	microscope
0	,
0	we
0	observed
0	first
0	a
0	kind
0	of
0	thin
0	tube
0	going
0	into
0	the
0	substance
0	of
0	this
0	little
0	globule
0	,
0	from
0	a
0	round
0	orifice
0	on
0	its
0	surface
0	.

0	The
0	inside
0	was
0	filled
0	with
0	four
0	or
0	five
0	oblong
0	intestine
0	bags
0	,
0	connected
0	with
0	the
0	tube
0	just
0	mentioned
0	.

0	The
0	same
0	appearances
0	were
0	observed
0	by
0	the
0	greatest
0	magnifier
0	,
0	and
0	were
0	only
0	more
0	distinct
0	.

0	I
0	wanted
0	to
0	examine
0	one
0	in
0	the
0	water
0	,
0	and
0	then
0	bring
0	it
0	under
0	the
0	microscope
0	,
0	but
0	I
0	could
0	not
0	provide
0	a
0	live
0	animalcule
0	:
0	they
0	were
0	all
0	dead
0	,
0	on
0	account
0	of
0	their
0	tender
0	structure
0	,
0	before
0	I
0	could
0	separate
0	them
0	from
0	the
0	finger
0	to
0	which
0	they
0	were
0	flicking
0	.

0	This
0	attempt
0	was
0	accordingly
0	frustrated
0	.

0	When
0	we
0	left
0	the
0	Cape
0	of
0	Good
0	Hope
0	,
0	on
0	November
0	the
0	22d
0	,
0	we
0	had
0	that
0	very
0	night
0	the
0	same
0	luminous
0	appearance
0	of
0	the
0	sea
0	,
0	and
0	a
0	very
0	hard
0	gale
0	.

0	Thus
0	we
0	have
0	again
0	a
0	new
0	cause
0	of
0	the
0	phosphoreal
0	light
0	.

0	But
0	,
0	before
0	we
0	proceed
0	with
0	our
0	remarks
0	,
0	let
0	us
0	only
0	follow
0	the
0	idea
0	arising
0	from
0	this
0	phaenomenon
0	.

0	The
0	immense
0	ocean
0	,
0	filled
0	with
0	myriads
0	of
0	animalcules
0	,
0	which
0	have
0	life
0	,
0	loco-motion
0	,
0	and
0	a
0	power
0	of
0	shining
0	in
0	the
0	dark
0	,
0	of
0	laying
0	that
0	power
0	aside
0	at
0	pleasure
0	,
0	and
0	illuminating
0	all
0	bodies
0	coming
0	in
0	contact
0	with
0	them
0	;

0	this
0	is
0	a
0	wonder
0	which
0	fills
0	the
0	mind
0	with
0	greater
0	astonishment
0	and
0	reverential
0	awe
0	,
0	than
0	it
0	is
0	in
0	my
0	power
0	justly
0	and
0	properly
0	to
0	describe
0	.

0	If
0	I
0	were
0	now
0	to
0	say
0	something
0	on
0	the
0	different
0	species
0	of
0	phosphoreal
0	light
0	,
0	I
0	could
0	by
0	no
0	means
0	give
0	my
0	assertion
0	,
0	that
0	degree
0	of
0	certainty
0	with
0	philosophers
0	would
0	require
0	.

0	I
0	will
0	therefore
0	confine
0	myself
0	to
0	some
0	probable
0	hints
0	concerning
0	their
0	real
0	causes
0	.

0	The
0	first
0	species
0	of
0	luminous
0	appearance
0	seems
0	to
0	be
0	produced
0	by
0	a
0	cause
0	altogether
0	different
0	from
0	the
0	rest
0	,
0	and
0	if
0	I
0	may
0	venture
0	to
0	declare
0	my
0	opinion
0	on
0	the
0	subject
0	,
0	I
0	should
0	think
0	,
0	that
0	this
0	light
0	is
0	owing
0	to
0	electricity
0	.

0	We
0	know
0	very
0	well
0	,
0	that
0	the
0	motion
0	of
0	a
0	ship
0	through
0	the
0	water
0	in
0	a
0	gale
0	,
0	is
0	extremely
0	swift
0	,
0	and
0	the
0	friction
0	caused
0	by
0	this
0	motion
0	very
0	great
0	:
0	for
0	we
0	find
0	that
0	the
0	sea
0	agitated
0	by
0	a
0	gale
0	of
0	wind
0	is
0	remarkably
0	warmer
0	,
0	than
0	the
0	air
0	.
0	*

0	The
0	bituminous
0	substances
0	,
0	which
0	cover
0	the
0	sides
0	of
0	ships
0	,
0	the
0	nails
0	sticking
0	in
0	the
0	bottom
0	,
0	and
0	the
0	conducting
0	power
0	of
0	water
0	will
0	equally
0	serve
0	to
0	explain
0	the
0	possibility
0	of
0	such
0	an
0	electricity
0	.

0	The
0	second
0	species
0	of
0	luminous
0	appearance
0	in
0	sea
0	water
0	seems
0	to
0	be
0	a
0	real
0	phosphoreal
0	light
0	.

0	It
0	is
0	very
0	well
0	known
0	,
0	that
0	many
0	animal
0	bodies
0	putrify
0	and
0	are
0	dissolved
0	in
0	the
0	sea
0	,
0	and
0	that
0	almost
0	every
0	part
0	of
0	animal
0	and
0	many
0	mineral
0	bodies
0	,
0	and
0	the
0	air
0	itself
0	,
0	contains
0	the
0	acid
0	of
0	phosphorus
0	as
0	an
0	integrant
0	part
0	.
0	=

0	The
0	addition
0	of
0	any
0	inflammable
0	principle
0	to
0	this
0	acid
0	,
0	will
0	produce
0	the
0	substance
0	we
0	call
0	phosphorus
0	.

0	Every
0	one
0	who
0	has
0	seen
0	salted
0	fish
0	drying
0	,
0	must
0	know
0	that
0	many
0	of
0	them
0	become
0	phosphoreal
0	.

0	It
0	is
0	likewise
0	a
0	well
0	established
0	fact
0	,
0	that
0	the
0	ocean
0	,
0	itself
0	after
0	a
0	long
0	continued
0	calm
0	,
0	becomes
0	stinking
0	and
0	highly
0	putrid
0	,
0	√ó
0	arising
0	probably
0	from
0	the
0	putrefaction
0	of
0	a
0	great
0	many
0	animal
0	substances
0	,
0	that
0	die
0	in
0	the
0	ocean
0	,
0	float
0	in
0	it
0	,
0	and
0	in
0	hot
0	calm
0	days
0	frequently
0	and
0	suddenly
0	putrefy
0	.

0	That
0	fishes
0	and
0	mollusca
0	contain
0	oily
0	and
0	inflammable
0	particles
0	is
0	equally
0	well
0	known
0	.

0	The
0	acid
0	of
0	phosphorus
0	disengaged
0	by
0	putrefaction
0	from
0	its
0	original
0	mixture
0	in
0	animal
0	bodies
0	,
0	may
0	easily
0	combine
0	with
0	some
0	of
0	the
0	just
0	mentioned
0	inflammables
0	,
0	and
0	thus
0	produce
0	a
0	phosphorus
0	floating
0	on
0	the
0	top
0	of
0	the
0	ocean
0	,
0	and
0	causing
0	that
0	luminous
0	appearance
0	,
0	which
0	we
0	so
0	much
0	admire
0	.

0	Lastly
0	the
0	third
0	kind
0	of
0	phosphoreal
0	light
0	no
0	doubt
0	arises
0	from
0	live
0	animals
0	floating
0	in
0	the
0	sea
0	and
0	is
0	owing
0	to
0	their
0	peculiar
0	structure
0	or
0	rather
0	the
0	nature
0	of
0	their
0	integrant
0	parts
0	,
0	which
0	perhaps
0	might
0	be
0	investigated
0	,
0	by
0	analyzing
0	chemically
0	some
0	of
0	the
0	mollusca
0	,
0	which
0	have
0	a
0	luminous
0	appearance
0	.

0	A
0	Suspicion
0	was
0	long
0	since
0	entertained
0	by
0	the
0	author
0	of
0	the
0	Universal
0	History
0	,
0	and
0	by
0	the
0	learned
0	and
0	ingenious
0	President
0	des
0	Brosses
0	,
0	*
0	of
0	a
0	great
0	Southern
0	continent
0	,
0	founded
0	on
0	the
0	argument
0	,
0	that
0	in
0	case
0	there
0	should
0	be
0	no
0	more
0	land
0	in
0	the
0	Southern
0	hemisphere
0	,
0	than
0	what
0	we
0	knew
0	before
0	,
0	it
0	would
0	be
0	insufficient
0	to
0	counterpoise
0	the
0	weight
0	of
0	lands
0	in
0	the
0	Northern
0	.

0	An
0	ingenious
0	author
0	,
0	whose
0	disinterested
0	zeal
0	for
0	the
0	promotion
0	of
0	geography
0	,
0	navigation
0	and
0	discoveries
0	is
0	not
0	less
0	conspicuous
0	,
0	than
0	his
0	many
0	virtues
0	as
0	a
0	man
0	,
0	a
0	citizen
0	and
0	a
0	friend
0	,
0	has
0	lately
0	=
0	endeavoured
0	to
0	set
0	these
0	arguments
0	in
0	a
0	stronger
0	light
0	.

0	Our
0	present
0	circumnavigation
0	has
0	,
0	I
0	believe
0	,
0	put
0	it
0	beyond
0	doubt
0	,
0	that
0	there
0	is
0	no
0	land
0	on
0	this
0	side
0	of
0	60
0	¬∞
0	in
0	the
0	Southern
0	hemisphere
0	,
0	if
0	we
0	except
0	the
0	few
0	inconsiderable
0	fragments
0	we
0	found
0	in
0	the
0	Southern
0	atlantic
0	ocean
0	.

0	If
0	therefore
0	we
0	should
0	even
0	suppose
0	,
0	that
0	the
0	whole
0	space
0	from
0	60
0	¬∞
0	and
0	upwards
0	,
0	where
0	we
0	have
0	not
0	been
0	,
0	be
0	intirely
0	occupied
0	by
0	land
0	,
0	this
0	would
0	be
0	still
0	too
0	inconsiderable
0	to
0	counterpoise
0	the
0	lands
0	of
0	the
0	Northern
0	hemisphere
0	.

0	I
0	am
0	therefore
0	apt
0	to
0	suspect
0	,
0	that
0	nature
0	has
0	provided
0	against
0	this
0	defect
0	,
0	by
0	placing
0	perhaps
0	at
0	the
0	bottom
0	of
0	the
0	Southern
0	ocean
0	such
0	bodies
0	as
0	by
0	their
0	specific
0	weight
0	will
0	compensate
0	the
0	deficiency
0	of
0	lands
0	;

0	if
0	this
0	system
0	of
0	the
0	wanted
0	counterpoise
0	be
0	at
0	all
0	necessary
0	.

0	But
0	there
0	may
0	perhaps
0	be
0	other
0	methods
0	to
0	obviate
0	this
0	defect
0	,
0	of
0	which
0	our
0	narrow
0	knowledge
0	and
0	experience
0	have
0	not
0	yet
0	informed
0	us
0	.

0	NOTHING
0	appeared
0	more
0	strange
0	to
0	the
0	several
0	navigators
0	in
0	high
0	latitudes
0	,
0	than
0	the
0	first
0	sight
0	of
0	the
0	immense
0	masses
0	of
0	ice
0	which
0	are
0	found
0	floating
0	in
0	the
0	ocean
0	;

0	and
0	I
0	must
0	confess
0	,
0	that
0	though
0	I
0	had
0	read
0	a
0	great
0	many
0	accounts
0	on
0	their
0	nature
0	,
0	figure
0	,
0	formation
0	and
0	magnitude
0	,
0	I
0	was
0	however
0	very
0	much
0	struck
0	by
0	their
0	first
0	appearance
0	.

0	The
0	real
0	grandeur
0	of
0	the
0	sight
0	by
0	far
0	surpassed
0	any
0	thing
0	I
0	could
0	expect
0	;

0	for
0	we
0	saw
0	sometimes
0	islands
0	of
0	ice
0	of
0	one
0	or
0	two
0	miles
0	extent
0	,
0	and
0	at
0	the
0	same
0	time
0	a
0	hundred
0	feet
0	or
0	upwards
0	above
0	water
0	.

0	We
0	will
0	suppose
0	,
0	that
0	ice
0	of
0	parallel
0	dimensions
0	swimming
0	in
0	sea-water
0	,
0	only
0	shews
0	one
0	part
0	out
0	of
0	ten
0	above
0	water
0	;
0	=

0	which
0	is
0	a
0	moderate
0	supposition
0	,
0	because
0	according
0	to
0	Mairan
0	√ó
0	ice
0	swimming
0	in
0	fresh
0	water
0	had
0	one
0	fourteenth
0	part
0	of
0	the
0	whole
0	above
0	its
0	surface
0	;

0	nay
0	,
0	Dr.
0	IrvingQ
0	plunged
0	a
0	piece
0	of
0	the
0	most
0	solid
0	ice
0	in
0	melted
0	snow
0	water
0	and
0	fourteen
0	fifteenth
0	parts
0	sunk
0	under
0	its
0	level
0	.

0	A
0	piece
0	therefore
0	of
0	only
0	one
0	mile
0	in
0	length
0	,
0	a
0	quarter
0	of
0	a
0	mile
0	in
0	breadth
0	,
0	and
0	100
0	feet
0	above
0	water
0	contains
0	696,960,000
0	cubic
0	feet
0	of
0	solid
0	ice
0	;

0	but
0	as
0	the
0	100
0	feet
0	,
0	are
0	only
0	the
0	contents
0	of
0	the
0	ice
0	above
0	water
0	,
0	the
0	same
0	must
0	be
0	taken
0	nine
0	times
0	more
0	for
0	the
0	contents
0	under
0	water
0	;

0	and
0	the
0	whole
0	will
0	then
0	amount
0	to
0	6,969,600,000
0	cubic
0	feet
0	of
0	solid
0	ice
0	,
0	which
0	must
0	of
0	course
0	be
0	a
0	stupendous
0	mass
0	.

0	But
0	the
0	enormous
0	size
0	of
0	these
0	icy
0	masses
0	is
0	not
0	the
0	only
0	object
0	of
0	our
0	astonishment
0	,
0	for
0	the
0	great
0	number
0	of
0	them
0	is
0	equally
0	surprizing
0	.

0	In
0	the
0	year
0	,
0	1773
0	on
0	the
0	26th
0	,
0	of
0	December
0	,
0	we
0	counted
0	186
0	masses
0	of
0	ice
0	all
0	in
0	sight
0	from
0	the
0	mast
0	head
0	,
0	whereof
0	none
0	was
0	less
0	than
0	the
0	hull
0	of
0	a
0	ship
0	.

0	At
0	other
0	times
0	we
0	were
0	every
0	where
0	surrounded
0	by
0	ice
0	islands
0	,
0	or
0	obliged
0	to
0	alter
0	our
0	course
0	,
0	because
0	it
0	was
0	obstructed
0	by
0	an
0	immense
0	field
0	of
0	ice
0	.

0	On
0	these
0	occasions
0	we
0	saw
0	first
0	small
0	pieces
0	of
0	loose
0	,
0	broken
0	ice
0	,
0	full
0	of
0	holes
0	and
0	pores
0	like
0	a
0	spunge
0	,
0	thus
0	wafted
0	by
0	the
0	continual
0	agitation
0	of
0	the
0	waves
0	;

0	behind
0	them
0	appeared
0	large
0	flat
0	and
0	solid
0	masses
0	,
0	of
0	an
0	immense
0	extent
0	.

0	Between
0	them
0	we
0	observed
0	stupendous
0	large
0	and
0	high
0	ice
0	islands
0	,
0	likewise
0	solid
0	but
0	formed
0	in
0	the
0	most
0	strange
0	manner
0	into
0	points
0	,
0	spires
0	and
0	broken
0	rocks
0	.

0	All
0	this
0	scene
0	of
0	ice
0	extended
0	as
0	far
0	as
0	the
0	eye
0	could
0	reach
0	.

0	However
0	,
0	it
0	is
0	likewise
0	remarkable
0	,
0	that
0	in
0	different
0	years
0	,
0	seasons
0	and
0	places
0	of
0	the
0	sea
0	,
0	we
0	found
0	the
0	ice
0	differently
0	situated
0	.

0	In
0	the
0	year
0	1772
0	,
0	December
0	the
0	10th
0	,
0	we
0	saw
0	the
0	ice
0	between
0	50
0	¬∞
0	and
0	51
0	¬∞
0	of
0	Southern
0	latitude
0	.

0	In
0	1773
0	on
0	December
0	the
0	12th
0	,
0	we
0	found
0	the
0	first
0	ice
0	in
0	62
0	¬∞
0	South
0	latitude
0	.

0	In
0	1775
0	,
0	in
0	January
0	the
0	27th
0	,
0	we
0	saw
0	ice
0	in
0	about
0	60
0	¬∞
0	South
0	latitude
0	.

0	On
0	February
0	the
0	24th
0	,
0	we
0	came
0	to
0	the
0	same
0	place
0	,
0	where
0	about
0	26
0	months
0	before
0	,
0	we
0	had
0	met
0	with
0	such
0	an
0	impenetrable
0	body
0	of
0	ice
0	,
0	as
0	had
0	obliged
0	us
0	to
0	run
0	to
0	the
0	East
0	;

0	but
0	where
0	at
0	this
0	last
0	time
0	no
0	vestige
0	of
0	it
0	appeared
0	no
0	more
0	than
0	at
0	the
0	place
0	,
0	where
0	BOUVET3
0	had
0	placed
0	his
0	Cape
0	Circumcision
0	,
0	we
0	having
0	sailed
0	over
0	the
0	whole
0	tract
0	,
0	which
0	he
0	suspected
0	to
0	be
0	land
0	;

0	nor
0	could
0	we
0	be
0	mistaken
0	in
0	its
0	situation
0	,
0	as
0	we
0	had
0	been
0	on
0	the
0	same
0	parallel
0	for
0	a
0	considerable
0	time
0	:
0	so
0	that
0	it
0	is
0	impossible
0	to
0	have
0	missed
0	the
0	land
0	,
0	if
0	any
0	had
0	existed
0	,
0	as
0	we
0	had
0	frequent
0	opportunities
0	to
0	ascertain
0	our
0	latitude
0	.

0	Another
0	circumstance
0	worthy
0	of
0	notice
0	is
0	,
0	that
0	all
0	ice
0	floating
0	in
0	the
0	sea
0	yields
0	fresh
0	water
0	when
0	melted
0	.

0	However
0	care
0	must
0	be
0	taken
0	never
0	to
0	collect
0	such
0	ice
0	which
0	is
0	spungy
0	and
0	honeycombed
0	from
0	the
0	agitation
0	of
0	the
0	waves
0	,
0	as
0	this
0	kind
0	of
0	ice
0	always
0	contained
0	considerable
0	quantity
0	of
0	brine
0	in
0	the
0	interstices
0	and
0	spungy
0	cavities
0	which
0	does
0	not
0	entirely
0	drain
0	from
0	it
0	by
0	suffering
0	it
0	to
0	lie
0	on
0	the
0	deck
0	of
0	the
0	ship
0	,
0	and
0	therefore
0	is
0	less
0	fit
0	for
0	yielding
0	good
0	potable
0	water
0	.

0	This
0	kind
0	of
0	ice
0	may
0	well
0	be
0	distinguished
0	from
0	the
0	more
0	solid
0	forts
0	both
0	by
0	its
0	appearance
0	and
0	by
0	its
0	situation
0	,
0	as
0	it
0	commonly
0	is
0	the
0	outermost
0	at
0	the
0	approach
0	of
0	any
0	large
0	quantity
0	of
0	ice
0	,
0	and
0	therefore
0	more
0	exposed
0	to
0	the
0	agitation
0	of
0	the
0	waves
0	.

0	To
0	leeward
0	of
0	large
0	ice
0	masses
0	,
0	commonly
0	loose
0	pieces
0	of
0	ice
0	are
0	drifting
0	of
0	various
0	sizes
0	;

0	those
0	that
0	are
0	nearest
0	the
0	large
0	mass
0	,
0	are
0	commonly
0	the
0	most
0	solid
0	,
0	and
0	therefore
0	the
0	most
0	proper
0	for
0	supplying
0	the
0	ship
0	with
0	water
0	.

0	Of
0	this
0	ice
0	,
0	such
0	pieces
0	are
0	taken
0	up
0	as
0	can
0	be
0	conveniently
0	lifted
0	into
0	the
0	boat
0	;

0	and
0	then
0	they
0	are
0	piled
0	up
0	on
0	the
0	quarter-deck
0	,
0	where
0	the
0	salt-water
0	,
0	adhering
0	to
0	its
0	outside
0	,
0	soon
0	drains
0	away
0	;

0	and
0	,
0	as
0	the
0	contact
0	of
0	the
0	deck
0	and
0	warmer
0	atmosphere
0	contributes
0	to
0	dissolve
0	some
0	part
0	of
0	the
0	ice
0	,
0	the
0	rest
0	becomes
0	quite
0	fresh
0	.

0	With
0	this
0	ice
0	the
0	boiler
0	is
0	filled
0	,
0	that
0	it
0	may
0	the
0	more
0	readily
0	be
0	dissolved
0	.

0	Other
0	ice
0	is
0	broken
0	into
0	such
0	pieces
0	as
0	will
0	go
0	through
0	the
0	bung-holes
0	into
0	the
0	water-casks
0	;

0	and
0	when
0	there
0	is
0	not
0	room
0	for
0	more
0	,
0	the
0	interstices
0	are
0	filled
0	up
0	,
0	with
0	the
0	water
0	from
0	the
0	boiler
0	,
0	which
0	soon
0	melts
0	the
0	small
0	pieces
0	of
0	ice
0	in
0	the
0	cask
0	.

0	When
0	we
0	came
0	to
0	leeward
0	of
0	extensive
0	portions
0	of
0	small
0	drifting
0	ice
0	,
0	or
0	such
0	as
0	the
0	Greenlandmen
0	call
0	packed
0	,
0	i.e.
0	on
0	the
0	edges
0	of
0	which
0	,
0	by
0	the
0	sea
0	and
0	pressure
0	of
0	the
0	ice
0	,
0	small
0	pieces
0	are
0	forced
0	up
0	,
0	we
0	always
0	found
0	the
0	sea
0	smooth
0	;

0	and
0	this
0	was
0	the
0	appearance
0	,
0	when
0	we
0	entered
0	the
0	loose
0	ice
0	on
0	January
0	the
0	17th
0	,
0	1773
0	,
0	in
0	67
0	¬∞
0	15
0	'
0	South
0	latitude
0	;

0	but
0	,
0	on
0	the
0	weather-side
0	of
0	the
0	ice
0	,
0	there
0	was
0	a
0	great
0	swell
0	and
0	high
0	surf
0	.

0	Whenever
0	we
0	approached
0	large
0	tracts
0	of
0	solid
0	ice
0	,
0	we
0	observed
0	,
0	on
0	the
0	horizon
0	,
0	a
0	white
0	reflexion
0	from
0	the
0	snow
0	and
0	ice
0	,
0	which
0	the
0	Greenlandmen
0	call
0	the
0	blink
0	of
0	the
0	ice
0	:
0	so
0	that
0	seeing
0	this
0	phaenomenon
0	appear
0	,
0	we
0	were
0	sure
0	to
0	be
0	within
0	a
0	few
0	leagues
0	of
0	the
0	ice
0	;

0	and
0	it
0	was
0	at
0	that
0	time
0	likewise
0	,
0	that
0	we
0	commonly
0	noticed
0	flights
0	of
0	white
0	petrels
0	of
0	the
0	size
0	of
0	pigeons
0	,
0	which
0	we
0	called
0	snowy
0	petrels
0	,
0	the
0	common
0	fore-runners
0	of
0	the
0	ice
0	.

0	It
0	has
0	been
0	observed
0	,
0	that
0	the
0	large
0	masses
0	of
0	ice
0	floating
0	in
0	the
0	ocean
0	,
0	cool
0	the
0	air
0	considerably
0	;

0	so
0	that
0	,
0	upon
0	approaching
0	them
0	,
0	the
0	change
0	may
0	be
0	sensibly
0	felt
0	.

0	On
0	the
0	11th
0	of
0	December
0	,
0	1772
0	,
0	on
0	a
0	clear
0	mild
0	day
0	,
0	before
0	we
0	reached
0	a
0	large
0	mass
0	of
0	ice
0	,
0	of
0	about
0	half
0	a
0	mile
0	in
0	length
0	,
0	and
0	a
0	hundred
0	feet
0	high
0	,
0	the
0	thermometer
0	on
0	deck
0	,
0	fixed
0	on
0	the
0	capstan
0	,
0	was
0	at
0	41
0	¬∞
0	.

0	When
0	we
0	were
0	to
0	leeward
0	of
0	it
0	,
0	the
0	thermometer
0	sunk
0	to
0	37
0	¬∞
0	;

0	and
0	when
0	we
0	had
0	passed
0	it
0	,
0	which
0	was
0	at
0	about
0	five
0	o
0	'clock
0	in
0	the
0	afternoon
0	,
0	it
0	had
0	risen
0	again
0	to
0	41
0	¬∞
0	.

0	On
0	December
0	the
0	13th
0	,
0	1772
0	,
0	in
0	the
0	morning
0	early
0	,
0	the
0	thermometer
0	was
0	at
0	about
0	32
0	¬∞
0	,
0	and
0	it
0	had
0	continued
0	to
0	snow
0	all
0	the
0	night
0	and
0	morning
0	.

0	In
0	the
0	morning
0	,
0	between
0	seven
0	and
0	eight
0	o
0	'clock
0	,
0	we
0	approached
0	a
0	great
0	many
0	ice-islands
0	,
0	some
0	of
0	which
0	were
0	of
0	vast
0	extent
0	.

0	At
0	eight
0	o
0	'clock
0	the
0	thermometer
0	pointed
0	at
0	31
0	¬∞
0	;

0	it
0	remained
0	there
0	when
0	we
0	were
0	just
0	to
0	leeward
0	of
0	the
0	largest
0	of
0	them
0	;

0	and
0	,
0	after
0	we
0	had
0	passed
0	it
0	,
0	the
0	thermometer
0	did
0	not
0	rise
0	higher
0	than
0	31
0	¬∞
0	.

0	I
0	believe
0	the
0	cold
0	was
0	not
0	lessened
0	,
0	because
0	the
0	deck
0	being
0	wet
0	from
0	the
0	snow
0	,
0	caused
0	a
0	great
0	evaporation
0	,
0	which
0	cooled
0	the
0	air
0	:
0	and
0	we
0	were
0	likewise
0	every
0	where
0	surrounded
0	by
0	large
0	ice-masses
0	,
0	which
0	had
0	so
0	much
0	cooled
0	the
0	atmosphere
0	all
0	round
0	,
0	that
0	it
0	remained
0	in
0	the
0	same
0	temperature
0	.

0	Both
0	these
0	instances
0	seem
0	therefore
0	to
0	prove
0	,
0	that
0	the
0	ice-masses
0	contribute
0	considerably
0	towards
0	cooling
0	the
0	atmosphere
0	.

0	The
0	ice
0	floats
0	in
0	an
0	ocean
0	,
0	which
0	in
0	the
0	summer
0	of
0	the
0	Southern
0	hemisphere
0	was
0	observed
0	to
0	be
0	many
0	degrees
0	above
0	the
0	freezing
0	point
0	;

0	it
0	must
0	therefore
0	continually
0	melt
0	and
0	decay
0	;

0	and
0	,
0	as
0	the
0	difference
0	of
0	the
0	specific
0	gravity
0	of
0	common
0	air
0	to
0	fresh
0	water
0	is
0	nearly
0	as
0	0.001
0	or
0	0.000
0	to
0	1.000
0	;

0	supposing
0	both
0	of
0	the
0	same
0	temperature
0	;

0	it
0	is
0	evident
0	that
0	fresh
0	water
0	must
0	melt
0	the
0	ice
0	,
0	more
0	than
0	common
0	air
0	,
0	as
0	the
0	particles
0	of
0	water
0	in
0	contact
0	with
0	the
0	ice
0	are
0	so
0	much
0	heavier
0	;

0	and
0	,
0	for
0	the
0	same
0	reason
0	as
0	sea-water
0	is
0	to
0	fresh
0	water
0	as
0	1.030
0	to
0	1.000
0	,
0	sea-water
0	must
0	act
0	still
0	more
0	upon
0	the
0	ice
0	than
0	fresh-water
0	.
0	*

0	We
0	had
0	frequent
0	opportunities
0	of
0	seeing
0	the
0	effect
0	of
0	the
0	sea-water
0	upon
0	the

0	,
0	in
0	dissolving

0	with
0	a
0	crash
0	not
0	inferior
0	to
0	the

0	and
0	sometimes

0	small

0	It
0	seems
0	to
0	be
0	undeniable
0	,
0	that
0	the

0	we
0	met

0	For

0	near

0	or
0	in
0	the
0	open
0	ocean
0	.

0	In
0	the
0	first
0	case
0	it
0	must
0	evidently
0	come
0	from
0	regions
0	lying
0	beyond

0	of

0	71

0	where
0	these
0	enormous
0	quantities
0	of
0	ice
0	could
0	possibly
0	have
0	been
0	generated
0	.

0	Or
0	,
0	in
0	the
0	second
0	case
0	,
0	if
0	the
0	ice
0	be
0	formed
0	far
0	from
0	any

0	,
0	this

0	be
0	farther
0	to

0	than
0	our

0	,
0	as
0	we
0	never

0	but
0	,
0	on
0	the
0	contrary

0	found
0	it
0	commonly

0	At
0	least
0	,
0	the
0	loose
0	ice
0	between
0	71
0	¬∞
0	and
0	50
0	¬∞
0	South
0	latitude
0	,
0	must
0	have

0	from

0	solid

0	beyond
0	71
0	¬∞
0	or
0	some
0	higher
0	latitude
0	.

0	Other
0	navigators
0	,
0	*
0	as
0	well
0	as
0	ourselves
0	,
0	have
0	met
0	with
0	ice
0	in
0	low
0	Southern
0	latitudes
0	,
0	i.e.
0	49
0	¬∞
0	,
0	50

0	,
0	51

0	,
0	and
0	52
0	¬∞
0	,
0	early
0	in
0	spring
0	and
0	summer
0	;

0	consequently
0	it
0	is
0	evident
0	,
0	that
0	it
0	must
0	have
0	drifted
0	to
0	these
0	low
0	latitudes
0	from
0	beyond

0	.

0	In
0	the
0	Northern
0	seas
0	,
0	it
0	is
0	a
0	common
0	and
0	obvious
0	phaenomenon
0	,
0	observed
0	almost
0	every
0	year
0	,
0	that
0	the
0	ice
0	moves
0	towards
0	warmer
0	climates
0	.

0	These
0	instances
0	,
0	therefore
0	,
0	seem
0	to
0	prove
0	,
0	that
0	there
0	is
0	either
0	a
0	strong
0	current
0	,
0	an
0	attraction
0	,
0	or
0	some
0	other
0	cause
0	acting
0	regularly
0	,
0	which
0	carries
0	these
0	large
0	masses
0	of
0	ice
0	from
0	each
0	pole
0	towards
0	the
0	equinoctial
0	line
0	.

0	I
0	should
0	here
0	finish
0	these
0	remarks
0	on
0	the
0	ice
0	,
0	if
0	it
0	were
0	not
0	necessary
0	to
0	say
0	something
0	concerning
0	its
0	formation
0	.

0	I
0	know
0	that
0	Mr.
0	de
0	Buffon
0	,
0	Q
0	Lomonosof
0	=
0	and
0	Crantz
0	√ó
0	were
0	of
0	opinion
0	that
0	the
0	ice
0	found
0	in
0	the
0	ocean
0	,
0	is
0	formed
0	near
0	lands
0	,
0	only
0	from
0	the
0	fresh
0	water
0	and
0	ice
0	carried
0	down
0	into
0	the
0	sea
0	by
0	the
0	many
0	rivers
0	in
0	Sibiria
0	,
0	Hudson
0	's
0	Bay
0	,
0	&amp;
0	amp
0	;

0	c.
0	and
0	therefore
0	when
0	we
0	fell
0	in
0	with
0	such
0	quantities
0	of
0	ice
0	in
0	December
0	,
0	1772
0	,
0	I
0	expected
0	we
0	should
0	soon
0	meet
0	with
0	the
0	land
0	,
0	from
0	whence
0	these
0	ice
0	masses
0	had
0	been
0	detached
0	.

0	doubts
0	concerning
0	the
0	existence
0	of
0	the
0	pretended
0	Southern
0	Continent
0	,
0	I
0	thought
0	it
0	necessary
0	to
0	enquire
0	,
0	what
0	reasons
0	chiefly
0	induced
0	the
0	above
0	authors
0	to
0	form
0	the
0	opinion
0	that
0	the
0	ice
0	floating
0	in
0	the
0	ocean
0	,
0	must
0	be
0	formed
0	near
0	land
0	,
0	or
0	that
0	an
0	Austral
0	land
0	is
0	absolutely
0	requisite

0	that
0	purpose
0	,
0	F
0	and
0	having
0	looked
0	for
0	their

0	,
0	I
0	find
0	they
0	amount
0	chiefly
0	to
0	this
0	;
0	"

0	that
0	the
0	ice
0	floating
0	in

0	is
0	all
0	fresh
0	,
0	that

0	water
0	does
0	not
0	freeze
0	at

0	or
0	if
0	it
0	does
0	,
0	it
0	contains

0	they
0	infer
0	from

0	,
0	that
0	the

0	be
0	formed
0	in
0	the

0	there

0	of

0	what

0	in
0	the

0	point
0	for
0	fixing
0	the
0	high

0	islands
0	is
0	the

0	,

0	First
0	,
0	they
0	observe
0	the
0	ice
0	floating
0	in
0	the
0	ocean
0	to
0	yield
0	by
0	melting
0	,
0	fresh
0	water
0	:
0	which
0	I
0	believe
0	to
0	be
0	true
0	;

0	however
0	hitherto
0	it
0	has
0	by
0	no
0	means
0	been
0	generally
0	allowed
0	to
0	be
0	fresh
0	,
0	for
0	Crantz
0	=
0	says
0	expressly
0	,
0	that
0	,
0	"
0	the
0	flat
0	pieces
0	(
0	forming
0	what
0	they
0	call
0	the
0	Ice-Fields
0	)
0	are
0	salt
0	,
0	because
0	they
0	were
0	congealed
0	from
0	sea
0	water
0	.
0	"

0	The
0	ice
0	taken
0	up
0	by
0	us
0	for
0	watering
0	the
0	ship
0	was
0	of
0	all
0	kinds
0	,
0	and
0	nevertheless
0	we
0	found
0	it
0	constantly
0	fresh
0	,
0	which
0	proves
0	,
0	either
0	that
0	the
0	principle
0	of
0	analogy
0	cannot
0	be
0	applied
0	indiscriminately
0	in
0	both
0	hemispheres
0	,
0	and
0	that
0	on
0	thing
0	may
0	be
0	true
0	in
0	the
0	Northern
0	hemisphere
0	,
0	which
0	is
0	quite
0	otherwise
0	in
0	the
0	Southern
0	,
0	from
0	reasons
0	not
0	yet
0	known
0	or
0	discovered
0	by
0	us
0	:
0	or
0	we
0	must
0	think
0	that
0	Crantz
0	and
0	others
0	are
0	mistaken
0	,
0	who
0	suppose
0	the
0	ice
0	floating
0	in
0	the
0	ocean
0	to
0	be
0	salt
0	.

0	The
0	next
0	remark
0	is
0	,
0	that
0	salt
0	water
0	does
0	not
0	freeze
0	at
0	all
0	,

0	if
0	it

0	79

0	is

0	considerably
0	broad

0	that

0	that
0	the

0	entirely

0	is
0	that

0	a
0	great

0	rivers
0	coming
0	from
0	Northern
0	regions
0	,
0	and
0	bringing
0	down
0	ice
0	;

0	that
0	this
0	sea
0	therefore
0	sometimes
0	freezes
0	to
0	such
0	a
0	degree
0	,
0	that
0	its
0	whole
0	surface
0	is
0	congealed
0	,
0	to
0	a
0	considerable
0	thickness
0	;

0	and
0	,
0	if
0	the
0	historians
0	are
0	to
0	be
0	credited
0	,
0	was
0	frozen

0	which
0	certainly
0	is
0	very
0	considerable
0	,

0	makes
0	it
0	more
0	than
0	probably
0	,
0	that

0	at
0	the

0	In
0	the
0	years
0	1685
0	and
0	1686
0	,
0	an
0	attempt
0	was
0	made

0	;

0	and
0	a

0	,
0	by
0	great
0	and
0	indefatigable
0	labour
0	,
0	continued
0	during
0	two
0	summer-seasons
0	,
0	succeeded
0	so
0	far
0	in
0	this
0	laborious
0	task
0	,
0	that
0	he
0	at
0	last
0	reached
0	the
0	depth

0	;

0	but
0	the
0	whole
0	earth
0	at
0	this
0	depth
0	was
0	frozen
0	,
0	and
0	he
0	met
0	with
0	no
0	water
0	,
0	which
0	forced
0	him
0	to
0	desist
0	from
0	so
0	fruitless
0	an

0	.
0	*

0	And
0	it
0	is
0	easy
0	to
0	infer
0	from
0	hence
0	,
0	how
0	impossible
0	it
0	is
0	,
0	that
0	springs
0	should
0	be
0	formed
0	in
0	the
0	womb
0	of
0	an
0	eternally
0	frozen
0	soil
0	.

0	But
0	let
0	us
0	now
0	compare
0	with
0	this
0	,
0	the
0	situation
0	of
0	the
0	pretended
0	unknown
0	Austral
0	lands
0	.

0	The
0	coast
0	of
0	this
0	land
0	must
0	be
0	to
0	the
0	South
0	of
0	our
0	navigation
0	,
0	in
0	60
0	¬∞
0	,
0	67
0	¬∞
0	,
0	and
0	71
0	¬∞
0	South
0	latitude
0	;

0	and
0	its
0	direction
0	we
0	will
0	allow
0	to
0	be
0	East
0	and
0	West
0	;

0	the
0	course
0	,
0	therefore
0	,
0	of
0	the
0	rivers
0	must
0	be
0	from
0	South
0	to
0	North
0	,
0	i.e.
0	from
0	the
0	interior
0	parts
0	of
0	the
0	land
0	towards
0	the
0	ocean
0	.

0	When
0	we
0	came
0	towards
0	the
0	54
0	¬∞
0	South
0	latitude
0	,
0	we
0	found
0	a
0	small
0	isle
0	of
0	about
0	80
0	leagues
0	in
0	circumference
0	;

0	the
0	thermometer
0	continued
0	at
0	about
0	30
0	¬∞
0	,
0	32
0	¬∞
0	,
0	and
0	34
0	¬∞
0	,
0	in
0	its
0	neighbourhood
0	,
0	in
0	the
0	midst
0	of
0	summer
0	;

0	though
0	isles
0	have
0	in
0	general
0	a
0	milder
0	climate
0	than
0	continents
0	,
0	we
0	found
0	,
0	however
0	,
0	all
0	this
0	country
0	entirely
0	covered
0	with
0	immense
0	loads
0	of
0	snow
0	,
0	the
0	bottoms
0	of
0	its
0	bays
0	were
0	choaked
0	up
0	with
0	solid
0	masses
0	of
0	ice
0	,
0	of
0	60
0	or
0	80
0	feet
0	above
0	water
0	,
0	and
0	we
0	saw
0	no
0	vestiges
0	either
0	of
0	rivers
0	or
0	of
0	springs
0	.

0	If
0	this
0	be
0	the
0	case
0	in
0	54
0	¬∞
0	South
0	latitude
0	,
0	how
0	can
0	we
0	then
0	expect
0	any
0	springs
0	or
0	rivers
0	in
0	60
0	¬∞
0	or
0	71
0	¬∞
0	South
0	latitude
0	,
0	or
0	rather
0	still
0	higher
0	up
0	to
0	the
0	South
0	,
0	where
0	the
0	sources
0	of
0	these
0	imaginary
0	rivers
0	of
0	the
0	pretended
0	Austral
0	land
0	,
0	must
0	be
0	removed
0	?

0	It
0	is
0	therefore
0	impossible
0	to
0	say
0	,
0	that
0	the
0	rivers
0	of
0	the
0	Austral
0	land
0	carried
0	those
0	ice-masses
0	into
0	the
0	ocean
0	,
0	which
0	we
0	met
0	with
0	in
0	such
0	stupendous
0	quantities
0	.

0	There
0	is
0	one
0	circumstance
0	more
0	,
0	which
0	surely
0	most
0	evidently
0	proves
0	,
0	that
0	there
0	is
0	no
0	land
0	in
0	those

0	,
0	which
0	are

0	In

0	,
0	there
0	is

0	such
0	a

0	In

0	there
0	is
0	no

0	met
0	with
0	.

0	The
0	French
0	searched
0	a

0	extent
0	of
0	the
0	shores
0	of
0	the
0	Falkland
0	Islands
0	,
0	with
0	great
0	care
0	,
0	but
0	found
0	not
0	above
0	one
0	or
0	two
0	pieces
0	of
0	wood
0	thrown
0	up
0	by

0	we
0	see
0	any
0	on
0	the

0	of
0	South-Georgia
0	:
0	all
0	which
0	sufficiently
0	evinces
0	the
0	truth
0	of
0	the
0	above
0	assertion
0	.

0	The
0	argument
0	,
0	therefore
0	,
0	is
0	now
0	reduced
0	to
0	this
0	,
0	"
0	That
0	salt-water
0	does
0	not
0	freeze
0	at

0	does
0	,
0	the

0	.

0	But
0	we
0	have
0	already
0	before
0	produced
0	numberless
0	instances
0	,
0	that
0	the

0	,
0	that
0	the

0	of

0	are
0	salt
0	,
0	because
0	they
0	were
0	congealed
0	from
0	sea-water
0	.

0	We
0	beg
0	leave
0	to
0	add
0	a
0	few
0	decisive
0	facts
0	relative
0	to

0	the

0	.

0	This
0	happened
0	in
0	the

0	of
0	September
0	;

0	what
0	effect
0	then
0	must
0	the
0	intense
0	frost
0	of
0	a
0	night
0	in
0	January
0	not
0	produce
0	?

0	When

0	wintered

0	the

0	froze
0	in
0	the

0	of
0	December
0	1631
0	:
0	it
0	remains
0	therefore
0	only
0	to
0	examine
0	,
0	whether
0	the

0	And
0	here
0	I
0	find
0	myself
0	in
0	a
0	very
0	disagreeable
0	dilemma
0	,
0	for

0	,
0	in

0	by

0	and
0	accurate

0	;

0	the

0	by

0	,
0	who
0	reads
0	Lectures
0	on
0	Chemistry
0	and
0	Natural
0	Philosophy
0	,
0	and
0	consequently
0	must
0	be
0	supposed
0	to
0	be
0	well
0	acquainted
0	with
0	the
0	subject.5
0	I
0	will
0	therefore
0	still
0	venture
0	to
0	consider
0	the
0	question
0	as
0	undecided
0	by
0	these
0	experiments
0	,
0	and
0	content
0	myself
0	with
0	making
0	a
0	few
0	observations
0	on
0	them
0	;

0	but
0	previously
0	I
0	beg
0	leave
0	to
0	make
0	this
0	general
0	remark
0	,
0	that
0	those
0	,
0	who
0	are
0	well
0	acquainted
0	with
0	Mechanics
0	,
0	Chemistry
0	,

0	and
0	the
0	various
0	Arts
0	which
0	require
0	a
0	nice
0	observation
0	of
0	minute
0	circumstances
0	,
0	need
0	not
0	be
0	informed
0	,
0	that
0	an
0	experiment
0	or
0	machine
0	,
0	succeeds
0	often
0	very
0	well
0	,
0	when
0	made
0	upon
0	a
0	smaller
0	scale
0	,
0	but
0	will
0	not
0	answer
0	if
0	undertaken
0	at
0	large
0	;

0	and
0	vice
0	versa
0	machines
0	and
0	experiments
0	executed
0	upon
0	a
0	small
0	scale
0	will
0	not
0	produce
0	the
0	effect
0	,
0	which
0	they
0	certainly
0	have
0	when
0	made
0	in
0	a
0	more
0	enlarged
0	manner
0	.

0	A
0	few
0	years
0	ago
0	an
0	experiment
0	made
0	on
0	the
0	dying
0	of
0	scarlet
0	,
0	did
0	not
0	succeed
0	when
0	undertaken
0	on
0	a
0	small
0	scale
0	,
0	whereas
0	it
0	produced
0	the
0	desired
0	effect
0	when
0	tried
0	at
0	a
0	dyer
0	's
0	house
0	with
0	the
0	large
0	apparatus
0	;

0	and
0	it
0	evidently
0	confirms
0	the
0	above
0	assertion
0	,
0	which
0	I
0	think
0	I
0	have
0	a
0	right
0	to
0	apply
0	to
0	the
0	freezing
0	of
0	salt-water
0	.

0	It
0	is
0	therefore
0	probable
0	,
0	that
0	the
0	ice
0	formed
0	in
0	the
0	ocean
0	at
0	large
0	,
0	in
0	a
0	higher
0	latitude
0	,
0	and
0	in
0	a
0	more
0	intense
0	degree
0	of
0	cold
0	,
0	whereof
0	we
0	have
0	no
0	idea
0	here
0	,
0	may
0	become
0	solid
0	,
0	and
0	free
0	from
0	any
0	briny
0	particles
0	,
0	though
0	a
0	few
0	experiments
0	made
0	by
0	Dr.
0	Higgins
0	,
0	in
0	his
0	house
0	,
0	on
0	the
0	freezing
0	of
0	salt-water
0	produced
0	only
0	a
0	loose
0	,
0	spungy
0	ice
0	,
0	filled
0	with
0	briny
0	particles
0	.

0	The
0	ice
0	formed
0	of
0	sea-water
0	by
0	Mr.
0	Nairne
0	,
0	was
0	very
0	hard
0	,
0	3
0	inches
0	long
0	,
0	and
0	2
0	inches
0	in
0	diameter
0	;

0	it
0	follows
0	from
0	thence
0	,
0	that
0	the
0	washing
0	the
0	outside
0	of
0	this
0	ice
0	in
0	fresh
0	water
0	,
0	could
0	not
0	affect
0	the
0	inside
0	of
0	a
0	hard
0	piece
0	of
0	ice
0	.

0	This
0	ice
0	when
0	melted
0	,
0	yielded
0	fresh
0	water
0	,
0	which
0	was
0	specifically
0	lighter
0	than
0	water
0	,
0	which
0	was
0	a
0	mixture
0	of
0	rain
0	and
0	snow
0	water
0	;

0	and
0	next
0	in
0	lightness
0	to
0	distilled
0	water
0	.

0	Had
0	the
0	ice
0	thus
0	obtained
0	,
0	not
0	been
0	fresh
0	,
0	the
0	residuum
0	of
0	the
0	sea
0	water
0	,
0	after
0	this
0	ice
0	had
0	been
0	taken
0	out
0	,
0	could
0	not
0	have
0	been
0	specifically
0	heavier
0	than
0	sea-water
0	,
0	which
0	however
0	was
0	the
0	case
0	in
0	Mr.
0	Nairne
0	's
0	experiment
0	.

0	It
0	seems
0	therefore
0	,
0	in
0	my
0	opinion
0	,
0	evident
0	from
0	hence
0	,
0	that
0	salt-water
0	does
0	freeze
0	,
0	and
0	has
0	no
0	other
0	briny
0	Particles
0	,
0	than
0	what
0	adhere
0	to
0	its
0	outside
0	.

0	All
0	this
0	perfectly
0	agrees
0	with
0	the
0	curious
0	fact
0	related
0	by
0	Mr.
0	Adanson
0	,
0	*
0	who
0	had
0	brought
0	to
0	France
0	two
0	bottles
0	of
0	sea-water
0	,
0	taken
0	up
0	in
0	different
0	parts
0	of
0	the
0	ocean
0	,
0	in
0	order
0	to
0	examine
0	it
0	and
0	to
0	compare
0	its
0	saltness
0	,
0	when
0	more
0	at
0	leisure
0	;

0	but
0	both
0	the
0	bottles
0	containing
0	the
0	salt-water
0	were
0	burst
0	by
0	being
0	frozen
0	,
0	and
0	the
0	water
0	produced
0	from
0	melting
0	the
0	ice
0	,
0	proved
0	perfectly
0	fresh
0	.

0	This
0	fact
0	is
0	so
0	fairly
0	stated
0	,
0	and
0	so
0	very
0	natural
0	,
0	that
0	I
0	cannot
0	conceive
0	it
0	is
0	necessary
0	to
0	suppose
0	,
0	=
0	without
0	the
0	least
0	foundation
0	for
0	it
0	,
0	that
0	the
0	bottles
0	were
0	changed
0	,
0	or
0	that
0	Mr.
0	Adanson
0	does
0	not
0	mention
0	the
0	circumstance
0	by
0	which
0	the
0	sea-water
0	was
0	thus
0	altered
0	upon
0	its
0	being
0	dissolved
0	;

0	for
0	as
0	he
0	expressly
0	observes
0	the
0	bottles
0	to
0	have
0	been
0	burst
0	,
0	it
0	is
0	obvious
0	that
0	the
0	concentrated
0	briny
0	parts
0	ran
0	out
0	and
0	were
0	entirely
0	drained
0	from
0	the
0	ice
0	,
0	which
0	was
0	formed
0	of
0	the
0	fresh
0	water
0	only
0	.

0	The
0	ice
0	formed
0	by
0	Dr.
0	Higgins
0	from
0	sea-water
0	,
0	consisted
0	of
0	thin
0	laminae
0	,
0	adhering
0	to
0	each
0	other
0	weakly
0	.

0	Dr.
0	Higgins
0	took
0	out
0	the
0	frozen
0	ice
0	from
0	the
0	vessels
0	,
0	wherein
0	he
0	exposed
0	the
0	sea-water
0	,
0	and
0	continued
0	to
0	do
0	so
0	till
0	the
0	remaining
0	concentrated
0	sea-water
0	began
0	to
0	form
0	crystals
0	of
0	sea
0	salt
0	.

0	Both
0	these
0	experiments
0	therefore
0	by
0	no
0	means
0	prove
0	what
0	the
0	Dr.
0	intended
0	to
0	infer
0	from
0	thence
0	;

0	for
0	it
0	was
0	wrong
0	to
0	take
0	out
0	such
0	ice
0	,
0	which
0	only
0	consisted
0	of
0	thin
0	laminae
0	,
0	adhering
0	to
0	each
0	other
0	weakly
0	.

0	Had
0	he
0	waited
0	with
0	patience
0	,
0	he
0	would
0	have
0	obtained
0	a
0	hard
0	ice
0	as
0	well
0	as
0	Mr.
0	Nairne
0	,
0	which
0	,
0	by
0	a
0	more
0	perfect
0	congelation
0	,
0	would
0	have
0	excluded
0	the
0	briny
0	particles
0	intercepted
0	between
0	the
0	thin
0	laminae
0	,
0	adhering
0	to
0	each
0	other
0	weakly
0	;

0	and
0	would
0	have
0	connected
0	the
0	laminae
0	,
0	by
0	others
0	formed
0	by
0	fresh
0	water
0	.

0	The

0	found
0	afterwards
0	,
0	it
0	is
0	true
0	,
0	thicker
0	and
0	somewhat
0	more
0	solid
0	ice
0	,
0	in
0	the

0	B
0	:
0	but
0	the
0	sea-water
0	had
0	already
0	been
0	so
0	much
0	concentrated
0	by
0	repeated
0	congelations
0	,
0	that
0	it
0	is
0	no

0	the
0	ice
0	formed
0	in

0	,
0	became
0	at

0	brackish
0	:
0	it
0	should
0	seem
0	then
0	,
0	that
0	no
0	conclusive
0	arguments
0	can
0	be
0	drawn
0	from
0	these

0	that

0	enough
0	to
0	congeal

0	But

0	,
0	that

0	,

0	cause
0	so
0	great
0	a

0	by

0	,
0	that
0	the

0	,
0	can
0	only
0	,
0	with
0	difficulty
0	hear

0	and
0	as
0	the

0	are
0	thrown
0	one
0	upon

0	,
0	ice-mountains
0	are
0	formed
0	by
0	it
0	.

0	And
0	I
0	observed
0	very
0	frequently
0	,
0	in
0	the
0	years
0	1772
0	and
0	1773
0	,
0	when
0	we
0	were
0	amongst

0	had
0	the
0	most
0	evident
0	marks
0	of
0	such

0	being
0	composed
0	of

0	of
0	some
0	feet
0	in

0	.

0	This
0	is
0	in
0	some
0	measure
0	confirmed
0	by
0	the
0	state
0	in
0	which
0	the
0	Cosack
0	Markoff
0	found

0	cliffs
0	,
0	but
0	far
0	out
0	at

0	;

0	and
0	when
0	these

0	were
0	climbed

0	nothing
0	but
0	ice

0	appeared
0	as

0	The
0	high
0	climates

0	,
0	of
0	several
0	yards
0	in

0	,
0	which
0	grow

0	more
0	compact
0	,

0	by
0	thaws
0	and
0	rain
0	,
0	are
0	formed
0	into
0	solid
0	ice
0	,
0	which
0	increase
0	the
0	stupendous
0	size
0	of
0	the
0	floating
0	ice-mountains
0	.

0	The
0	second
0	objection
0	against
0	the
0	freezing
0	of
0	the
0	ocean
0	into
0	such
0	ice
0	as
0	is
0	found
0	floating
0	in
0	it
0	,
0	is
0	taken
0	from
0	the
0	opacity
0	of
0	ice
0	formed
0	in
0	salt-water
0	;

0	because
0	the
0	largest
0	masses
0	are
0	commonly
0	transparent
0	like
0	crystal
0	,
0	with
0	a
0	fine
0	blue
0	tinct
0	,
0	caused
0	by
0	the
0	reflection
0	of
0	the
0	sea
0	.

0	This
0	argument
0	is
0	very
0	specious
0	,
0	and
0	might
0	be
0	deemed
0	unanswerable
0	to
0	those
0	,
0	who
0	are
0	not
0	used
0	to
0	cold
0	winters
0	,
0	and
0	their
0	effects
0	;

0	but
0	whosoever
0	has
0	spent
0	several
0	winters
0	in
0	countries
0	,
0	which
0	are
0	subject
0	to
0	intense
0	frosts
0	,
0	will
0	find
0	nothing
0	extraordinary
0	or
0	difficult
0	in
0	this
0	argument
0	:
0	for
0	it
0	is
0	a
0	well-known
0	fact
0	in
0	cold
0	countries
0	,
0	that
0	the
0	ice
0	,
0	which
0	covers
0	their
0	lakes
0	and
0	rivers
0	,
0	is
0	often
0	opaque
0	,
0	especially
0	when
0	the
0	frost
0	sets
0	in
0	,
0	accompanied
0	by
0	a
0	fall
0	of
0	snow
0	;

0	for
0	,
0	in
0	those
0	instances
0	,
0	the
0	ice
0	looks
0	,
0	before
0	it
0	hardens
0	,
0	like
0	a
0	dough
0	or
0	paste
0	,
0	and
0	when
0	congealed
0	it
0	is
0	opaque
0	and
0	white
0	;

0	however
0	in
0	spring
0	,
0	a
0	rain
0	and
0	the
0	thaw
0	,
0	followed
0	by
0	frosty
0	nights
0	,
0	change
0	the
0	opacity
0	and
0	colour
0	of
0	the
0	ice
0	,
0	and
0	make
0	it
0	quite
0	transparent
0	and
0	colourless
0	like
0	a
0	crystal
0	;

0	but
0	,
0	in
0	case
0	the
0	thaw
0	continues
0	,
0	and
0	it
0	ceases
0	entirely
0	to
0	freeze
0	,
0	the
0	same
0	transparent
0	ice
0	become
0	soft
0	and
0	porous
0	,
0	and
0	turns
0	again
0	entirely
0	opaque.Q
0	This
0	,
0	I
0	believe
0	,
0	may
0	be
0	applicable
0	to
0	the
0	ice
0	seen
0	by
0	us
0	in
0	the
0	ocean
0	.

0	The
0	field-ice
0	was
0	commonly
0	opaque
0	;

0	some
0	of
0	the
0	large
0	masses
0	,
0	probably
0	drenched
0	by
0	rain
0	,
0	and
0	frozen
0	again
0	,
0	were
0	transparent
0	and
0	pellucid
0	;

0	but
0	the
0	small
0	fragments
0	of
0	loose
0	ice
0	,
0	formed
0	by
0	the
0	decay
0	of
0	the
0	large
0	masses
0	,
0	and
0	soaked
0	by
0	long
0	continued
0	rains
0	,
0	we
0	found
0	to
0	be
0	porous
0	,
0	soft
0	,
0	and
0	opaque
0	.

0	It
0	is
0	likewise
0	urged
0	as
0	an
0	argument
0	against
0	the
0	formation
0	of
0	ice

0	First
0	,
0	I
0	observe
0	,
0	that
0	in
0	Mr.
0	Nairne
0	's
0	experiments
0	,
0	the
0	ice
0	was
0	generated
0	on
0	the
0	surface
0	,
0	and
0	was
0	seen
0	shooting
0	crystals
0	downwards
0	;

0	which
0	evidently
0	evinces
0	,
0	in
0	my
0	opinion
0	,
0	that
0	ice
0	is
0	there
0	formed
0	or
0	generated
0	where
0	the
0	intensest
0	cold
0	is
0	;

0	as
0	the
0	air
0	sooner
0	cools
0	the
0	surface
0	,
0	than
0	the
0	depth
0	of
0	the
0	ocean
0	,
0	the
0	ice
0	shoots
0	naturally
0	downwards
0	,
0	and
0	cools
0	the
0	ocean
0	more
0	and
0	more
0	,
0	by
0	which
0	it
0	is
0	prepared
0	for
0	further
0	congelation
0	.

0	I
0	suppose
0	,
0	however
0	,
0	that
0	this
0	happens
0	always
0	during
0	calms
0	,
0	which
0	are
0	not
0	uncommon
0	in
0	high
0	latitudes
0	,
0	as
0	we
0	experienced
0	in
0	the
0	late
0	expedition
0	.

0	Nor
0	does
0	land
0	seem
0	absolutely
0	necessary
0	in
0	order
0	to
0	fix
0	the
0	ice
0	;

0	for
0	this
0	may
0	be
0	done
0	with
0	as
0	much
0	ease
0	and
0	propriety
0	to
0	the
0	large
0	ice-mountains
0	,
0	which
0	remain
0	undissolved
0	floating
0	in
0	the

0	in
0	high

0	:
0	or
0	it
0	may
0	,
0	perhaps
0	,
0	not
0	be
0	improper
0	to
0	suppose
0	,
0	that
0	the

0	Polar

0	,
0	from
0	80
0	¬∞
0	and
0	upwards
0	,
0	in

0	remains
0	a
0	solid
0	ice
0	for
0	several
0	years
0	together
0	,
0	to
0	which
0	yearly
0	a
0	new
0	circle
0	of

0	,
0	and
0	of

0	,
0	however
0	,

0	is

0	Wherever

0	of
0	raising
0	high
0	and

0	.

0	This

0	and

0	,
0	who
0	sometimes
0	undertook
0	long
