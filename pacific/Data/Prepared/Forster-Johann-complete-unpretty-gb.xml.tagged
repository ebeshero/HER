0	THE

0	of
0	the
0	earth
0	contains
0	,
0	as
0	far
0	as
0	we

0	,
0	three
0	large
0	masses
0	of
0	land
0	.

0	In
0	the
0	Eastern
0	hemisphere
0	we
0	find
0	first
0	that
0	mass
0	,
0	which
0	is
0	commonly
0	called
0	the
0	Old
0	World
0	,
0	and
0	which
0	comprehends
0	three
0	large
0	parts
0	,
0	bearing
0	the
0	appellation
0	of
0	Continents
0	,
0	and
0	distinguished
0	by
0	the
0	names
0	of
PLACE-B	Europe
0	,
PLACE-B	Asia
0	,
0	and
PLACE-B	Africa
0	.

0	The
0	next
0	in
0	size
0	,
0	and
0	in
0	the
0	order
0	of
0	time
0	,
0	when
0	it
0	was
0	made
0	known
0	to

0	,
0	is
0	situated
0	in
0	the
0	Western
0	hemisphere
0	,
0	and
0	called
PLACE-B	America
0	.

0	The
0	third
0	large
0	mass
0	of
0	land
0	lies
0	in
0	the
0	South-East
0	part
0	of
0	our
0	hemisphere
0	,
0	and
0	its
0	Eastern
0	limits
0	have
0	been
0	but
0	lately
0	ascertained
0	by
0	that
0	indefatigable
0	and
0	intelligent
0	navigator
0	,
PERSON-B	Capt.
PERSON-I	Cook
0	,
0	in
0	the
0	year
0	1770
0	.

0	Its
0	Western
0	and
0	Northern
0	limits
0	were
0	first
0	discovered
0	in
0	1616
0	and
0	the
0	following
0	years
0	,
0	by
0	the
0	Dutch
0	navigators
0	,
0	when
0	a
0	noble
0	spirit
0	of
0	discovery
0	still
0	animated
0	the
0	governors
0	of
0	their
PLACE-B	Indian
PLACE-I	settlements
0	.

0	Since
0	that
0	time
0	it
0	has
0	been
0	visited
0	,
0	and
0	severally
0	seen
0	,
0	by
0	Dutch
0	and
0	English
0	navigators
0	,
0	and
0	the
0	whole
0	was
0	called
0	in
0	1644
0	New-Holland
0	,
0	from
0	its
0	first
0	discoverers
0	.

0	Perhaps
0	many
0	will
0	dissent
0	from
0	me
0	,
0	and
0	refuse
0	to
0	call
0	it
0	a
0	Continent
0	,
0	though
0	it
0	be
0	little
0	,
0	if
0	at
0	all
0	,
0	inferior
0	to
PLACE-B	Europe
0	,
0	to
0	which
0	no
0	one
0	has
0	hitherto
0	hesitated
0	to
0	give
0	that
0	name
0	.

0	It
0	must
0	be
0	allowed
0	,
0	that
0	New-Holland
0	is
0	at
0	present
0	the
0	most
0	backward
0	of
0	all
0	the
0	lands
0	called
0	Continents
0	,
0	in
0	point
0	of
0	population
0	,
0	and
0	utility
0	to
PLACE-B	Europe
0	;

0	but
0	this
0	objection
0	is
0	of
0	little
0	weight
0	,
0	since
0	it
0	may
0	perhaps
0	,
0	in
0	future
0	ages
0	,
0	become
0	as
0	populous
0	as
0	any
0	of
0	the
0	other
0	continents
0	,
0	and
0	equally
0	useful
0	;

0	as
0	I
0	believe
0	it
0	to
0	be
0	very
0	likely
0	to
0	supply
0	the
0	wants
0	of
0	European
0	colonies
0	.

0	We
0	know
0	this
0	land
0	but
0	imperfectly
0	,
0	and
0	all
0	our
0	navigators
0	seem
0	to
0	complain
0	that
0	it
0	is
0	deficient
0	in
0	fresh
0	water
0	and
0	large
0	rivers
0	;

0	but
0	,
0	had
0	they
0	properly
0	and
0	carefully
0	examined
0	its
0	circuit
0	,
0	especially
0	its
0	South-Western
0	shores
0	,
0	their
0	enquiries
0	would
0	perhaps
0	have
0	been
0	rewarded
0	with
0	success
0	;

0	for
0	it
0	is
0	highly
0	probable
0	,
0	that
0	a
0	land
0	of
0	so
0	great
0	extent
0	contains
0	high
0	mountains
0	in
0	its
0	interior
0	parts
0	;

0	and
0	wherever
0	those
0	are
0	,
0	there
0	must
0	be
0	rivers
0	.

0	These
0	would
0	invite
0	European
0	settlers
0	;

0	especially
0	such
0	as
0	would
0	be
0	willing
0	to
0	withdraw
0	themselves
0	from
0	the
0	oppressions
0	of
0	growing
0	despotism
0	in
0	Europe.1
0	To
0	such
0	sons
0	of
0	liberty
0	this
0	continent
0	would
0	offer
0	a
0	new
0	and
0	happy
0	asylum
0	:
0	by
0	which
0	means
0	it
0	might
0	become
0	the
0	seat
0	of
0	sciences
0	and
0	arts
0	;

0	happy
0	in
0	its
0	cultivation
0	,
0	the
0	riches
0	of
0	its
0	productions
0	,
0	and
0	the
0	number
0	of
0	its
0	inhabitants
0	.

0	The
0	rest
0	of
0	the
0	lands
0	,
0	not
0	comprehended
0	under
0	those
0	now
0	enumerated
0	,
0	are
0	only
0	islands
0	.

0	In
0	our
0	voyage
0	we
0	touched
0	at
0	the
PLACE-B	Cape
PLACE-I	of
PLACE-I	Good
PLACE-I	Hope
0	in
PLACE-B	Africa
0	:
0	we
0	saw
0	only
0	the
0	last
0	fragments
0	of
PLACE-B	America
0	along
0	the
0	coast
0	of
0	Tierra
0	del
0	Fuego
0	,
0	and
0	besides
0	these
0	,
0	our
0	own
0	continent
0	from
0	which
0	we
0	came
0	,
0	and
0	to
0	which
0	we
0	again
0	returned
0	.

0	We
0	have
0	therefore
0	nothing
0	to
0	say
0	in
0	particular
0	relative
0	to
0	large
0	lands
0	,
0	if
0	we
0	except
0	a
0	single
0	remark
0	,
0	which
0	we
0	collected
0	from
0	the
0	accounts
0	of
0	our
0	friends
0	on
0	board
0	the
0	Adventure
0	,
0	who
0	saw
0	part
0	of
0	New-Holland
0	in
0	1773
0	.

0	The
0	Southernmost
0	extremity
0	of
0	this
0	continent
0	has
0	a
0	great
0	familiarity
0	to
0	all
0	the
0	Southern
0	points
0	and
0	extremities
0	of
0	continents
0	,
0	and
0	therefore
0	appears
0	black
0	,
0	rocky
0	,
0	and
0	of
0	considerable
0	elevation
0	;
0	*

0	though
0	farther
0	to
0	the
0	North
0	,
0	the
0	country
0	is
0	even
0	,
0	and
0	without
0	any
0	remarkably
0	high
0	hills
0	,
0	at
0	least
0	near
0	the
0	shores
0	.

0	I
0	pretend
0	not
0	to
0	defend
0	any
0	particular
0	hypothesis
0	relative
0	to
0	the
0	theory
0	of
0	the
0	earth
0	;

0	but
0	,
0	if
0	we
0	cast
0	our
0	eyes
0	on
0	the
0	two
0	hemispheres
0	of
0	our
0	globe
0	,
0	such
0	as
0	they
0	are
0	known
0	since
0	our
0	last
0	voyage
0	,
0	they
0	seem
0	to
0	offer
0	some
0	curious
0	particulars
0	to
0	our
0	view
0	.

0	All
0	the
0	remarkable
0	Southern
0	points
0	of
0	lands
0	on
0	our
0	globe
0	,
0	have
0	a
0	great
0	and
0	striking
0	similarity
0	in
0	regard
0	to
0	their
0	conformation
0	,
0	and
0	the
0	situation
0	of
0	islands
0	in
0	their
0	vicinity
0	.

0	They
0	are
0	all
0	high
0	and
0	rocky
0	;

0	each
0	seems
0	to
0	be
0	the
0	extremity
0	of
0	a
0	range
0	of
0	high
0	mountains
0	running
0	northward
0	.

0	All
0	have
0	to
0	the
0	Eastward
0	one
0	or
0	more
0	large
0	islands
0	.

0	Nay
0	,
0	if
0	we
0	continue
0	the
0	comparison
0	,
0	all
0	continents
0	have
0	a
0	great
0	sinuosity
0	on
0	the
0	West-side
0	towards
0	the
0	north
0	.

0	So
0	many
0	coinciding
0	circumstances
0	seem
0	,
0	not
0	to
0	be
0	merely
0	accidental
0	,
0	but
0	rather
0	to
0	proceed
0	from
0	one
0	and
0	the
0	same
0	general
0	cause
0	.

0	I
0	do
0	not
0	pretend
0	to
0	point
0	out
0	this
0	first
0	cause
0	,
0	but
0	cannot
0	help
0	suspecting
0	,
0	that
0	a
0	violent
0	flood
0	coming
0	from
0	the
0	South-West
0	has
0	produced
0	this
0	striking
0	identity
0	of
0	conformation
0	in
0	these
0	lands
0	,
0	though
0	I
0	can
0	neither
0	point
0	out
0	the
0	time
0	when
0	this
0	great
0	revolution
0	happened
0	,
0	nor
0	assign
0	any
0	reason
0	for
0	its
0	operating
0	in
0	this
0	manner
0	.

0	It
0	suffices
0	to
0	have
0	mentioned
0	the
0	fact
0	,
0	and
0	hinted
0	at
0	the
0	next
0	cause
0	,
0	without
0	any
0	ostentation
0	.

PLACE-B	America
0	has
0	the
PLACE-B	Andes
0	running
0	from

0	extending
0	even
0	beyond

0	.

0	The
0	sinuosity
0	on

0	which

0	day
0	,
0	in
0	my

0	,
0	at
0	78

0	and
0	which
0	,
0	having
0	been
0	carried
0	close
0	to
0	my
0	body
0	in
0	a
0	pocket
0	,
0	I
0	found
0	at
0	80
0	°
0	)
0	,
0	and
0	having
0	placed
0	it
0	in
0	the
0	hot
0	well
0	,
0	so
0	that
0	the
0	whole
0	bulb
0	and
0	tube
0	were
0	covered
0	,
0	the
0	quicksilver
0	rose
0	soon
0	to
0	191
0	°
0	,
0	but
0	after
0	having
0	been
0	for
0	five
0	minutes
0	in
0	the
0	well
0	,
0	it
0	did
0	not
0	rise
0	above
0	that
0	degree
0	.

0	I
0	took
0	the
0	thermometer
0	out
0	,
0	and
0	cleared
0	the
0	well
0	still
0	better
0	,
0	and
0	made
0	the
0	excavation
0	of
0	the
0	stone
0	below
0	deeper
0	,
0	and
0	then
0	immersed
0	it
0	again
0	during
0	ten
0	minutes
0	,
0	but
0	found
0	it
0	all
0	the
0	time
0	at
0	191
0	°
0	.

0	This
0	was
0	done
0	August
0	the
0	17th
0	,
0	1774
0	,
0	at
0	4h
0	30
0	'
0	P.M.
0	at
0	high-water
0	.

0	We
0	returned
0	the
0	next
0	morning
0	about
0	nine
0	o
0	'clock
0	,
0	when
0	the
0	water
0	was
0	low
0	;

0	and
0	,
0	upon
0	immersing
0	the
0	thermometer
0	as
0	before
0	,
0	we
0	observed
0	the
0	quicksilver
0	to
0	rise
0	to
0	187
0	°
0	in
0	the
0	space
0	of
0	one
0	minute
0	and
0	a
0	half
0	;

0	at
0	which
0	degree
0	it
0	remained
0	,
0	though
0	the
0	thermometer
0	continued
0	several
0	minutes
0	longer
0	in
0	the
0	water
0	.

0	I
0	threw
0	some
0	small
0	fish
0	,
0	and
0	some
0	muscles
0	,
0	into
0	the
0	hot
0	water
0	,
0	and
0	they
0	were
0	boiled
0	in
0	a
0	few
0	minutes
0	.

0	The
0	water
0	is
0	clear
0	and
0	limpid
0	,
0	and
0	has
0	no
0	peculiar
0	taste
0	,
0	except
0	that
0	I
0	thought
0	it
0	to
0	have
0	a
0	very
0	faint
0	astringency
0	.

0	I
0	put
0	a
0	piece
0	of
0	fine
0	and
0	bright
0	silver
0	into
0	it
0	,
0	which
0	having
0	lain
0	for
0	more
0	than
0	an
0	hour
0	in
0	it
0	,
0	came
0	out
0	untarnished
0	.

0	I
0	put
0	a
0	small
0	quantity
0	of
0	solution
0	of
0	salt
0	of
0	tartar
0	in
0	it
0	,
0	but
0	it
0	did
0	not
0	precipitate
0	any
0	thing
0	,
0	though
0	I
0	increased
0	the
0	quantity
0	of
0	the
0	tartar
0	.

0	I
0	had
0	no
0	other
0	substances
0	with
0	me
0	to
0	try
0	the
0	water
0	by
0	other
0	methods
0	.

0	On
0	the
0	same
0	cliff
0	,
0	but
0	close
0	to
0	the
0	sandy
0	beach
0	,
0	at
0	the
0	bottom
0	of
0	the
0	harbour
0	,
0	there
0	are
0	two
0	other
0	hot
0	springs
0	.

0	We
0	came
0	on
0	the
0	same
0	morning
0	,
0	Aug.
0	the
0	18th
0	,
0	half
0	an
0	hour
0	later
0	,
0	to
0	these
0	springs
0	.

0	I
0	hollowed
0	out
0	the
0	sand
0	to
0	gather
0	some
0	of
0	the
0	hot
0	water
0	,
0	and
0	immersed
0	my
0	thermometer
0	just
0	at
0	the
0	place
0	where
0	the
0	water
0	bubbles
0	up
0	,
0	and
0	in
0	about
0	two
0	minutes
0	time
0	the
0	quicksilver
0	rose
0	to
0	202
0	°
0	,
0	and
0	remained
0	for
0	several
0	minutes
0	in
0	the
0	water
0	without
0	rising
0	higher
0	.

0	On
0	the
0	same
0	cliff
0	,
0	on
0	a
0	brow
0	about
0	60
0	or
0	80
0	fathoms
0	higher
0	,
0	we
0	found
0	a
0	place
0	clear
0	of
0	trees
0	,
0	where
0	in
0	cool
0	weather
0	,
0	especially
0	after
0	rain
0	,
0	we
0	could
0	discover
0	from
0	the
0	ship
0	,
0	steams
0	rising
0	,
0	which
0	were
0	still
0	more
0	distinctly
0	observed
0	when
0	we
0	came
0	close
0	to
0	the
0	place
0	.

0	We
0	found
0	ourselves
0	,
0	after
0	a
0	few
0	minutes
0	stay
0	,
0	in
0	a
0	profuse
0	perspiration
0	,
0	occasioned
0	by
0	the
0	hot
0	steams
0	,
0	and
0	the
0	heat
0	of
0	the
0	ground
0	we
0	stood
0	on
0	,
0	which
0	in
0	some
0	places
0	was
0	intolerable
0	.

0	When
0	the
0	volcano
0	made
0	an
0	explosion
0	,
0	we
0	always
0	saw
0	a
0	new
0	quantity
0	of
0	vapours
0	and
0	steams
0	pierce
0	these
0	spiracula
0	,
0	which
0	are
0	apparently
0	shut
0	up
0	,
0	but
0	seem
0	to
0	have
0	a
0	cavity
0	underneath
0	;

0	for
0	the
0	whole
0	mountain
0	gave
0	a
0	hollow
PLACE-B	sound
0	,
0	when
0	we
0	were
0	walking
0	on
0	the
0	footpath
0	leading
0	to
0	these
0	solfataras
0	;

0	and
0	I
0	likewise
0	traced
0	a
0	train
0	of
0	these
0	spiracula
0	,
0	both
0	above
0	and
0	below
0	on
0	the
0	sides
0	of
0	this
0	hill
0	,
0	as
0	far
0	as
0	within
0	a
0	few
0	yards
0	of
0	the
0	hot
0	wells
0	.

0	I
0	saw
0	the
0	solfataras
0	three
0	times
0	.

0	The
0	second
0	time
0	I
0	took
0	my
0	thermometer
0	with
0	me
0	,
0	and
0	having
0	dug
0	a
0	hole
0	about
0	a
0	foot
0	deep
0	,
0	I
0	hung
0	the
0	thermometer
0	in
0	it
0	by
0	the
0	ribbon
0	on
0	its
0	top
0	,
0	to
0	a
0	stick
0	laid
0	across
0	the
0	hole
0	;

0	and
0	I
0	saw
0	it
0	rise
0	from
0	80
0	°
0	in
0	a
0	few
0	seconds
0	to
0	170
0	°
0	:
0	having
0	left
0	the
0	thermometer
0	for
0	four
0	minutes
0	in
0	the
0	hole
0	,
0	I
0	found
0	it
0	still
0	at
0	170
0	°
0	,
0	and
0	though
0	I
0	repeated
0	this
0	at
0	one
0	minute
0	's
0	interval
0	,
0	three
0	times
0	,
0	the
0	mercury
0	was
0	still
0	at
0	the
0	same
0	degree
0	.

0	When
0	I
0	took
0	it
0	out
0	,
0	it
0	fell
0	in
0	a
0	second
0	's
0	time
0	to
0	160
0	°
0	,
0	and
0	gradually
0	lower
0	.

0	In
0	my
0	cabin
0	on
0	board
0	the
0	ship
0	,
0	it
0	stood
0	at
0	78
0	°
0	;

0	having
0	been
0	carried
0	close
0	to
0	my
0	body
0	up
0	the
0	hill
0	,
0	by
0	a
0	long
0	ascent
0	,
0	it
0	rose
0	to
0	87
0	°
0	;

0	I
0	hung
0	it
0	therefore
0	in
0	the
0	open
0	air
0	,
0	in
0	the
0	shade
0	of
0	a
0	tree
0	on
0	the
0	hill
0	,
0	about
0	twenty
0	yards
0	from
0	the
0	smoking
0	place
0	,
0	for
0	about
0	five
0	minutes
0	,
0	and
0	found
0	it
0	to
0	stand
0	at
0	80
0	°
0	,
0	and
0	to
0	remain
0	at
0	the
0	same
0	height
0	for
0	a
0	long
0	while
0	after
0	.

0	When
0	I
0	was
0	digging
0	the
0	hole
0	for
0	the
0	reception
0	of
0	the
0	thermometer
0	,
0	the
0	natives
0	seemed
0	uneasy
0	,
0	and
0	were
0	apprehensive
0	the
0	place
0	would
0	be
0	on
0	fire.4
0	This
0	happened
0	on
0	August
0	the
0	12th
0	at
0	about
0	ten
0	o
0	'clock
0	in
0	the
0	morning
0	.

0	I
0	went
0	up
0	again
0	on
0	August
0	the
0	14th
0	in
0	the
0	forenoon
0	,
0	and
0	repeated
0	the
0	experiment
0	with
0	this
0	difference
0	only
0	,
0	that
0	we
0	entirely
0	buried
0	the
0	thermometer
0	in
0	the
0	hole
0	,
0	by
0	putting
0	loose
0	earth
0	round
0	it
0	.

0	It
0	had
0	stood
0	that
0	day
0	in
0	my
0	cabin
0	at
0	78
0	°
0	,
0	on
0	the
0	hill
0	at
0	80
0	°
0	;

0	but
0	after
0	having
0	been
0	buried
0	a
0	minute
0	,
0	it
0	rose
0	to
0	210
0	°
0	and
0	there
0	it
0	remained
0	stationary
0	for
0	five
0	minutes
0	.

0	As
0	I
0	could
0	trace
0	the
0	spiracula
0	of
0	hot
0	steams
0	,
0	blended
0	with
0	some
0	sulphureous
0	smell
0	,
0	all
0	along
0	the
0	side
0	of
0	the
0	hill
0	,
0	down
0	to
0	the
0	hot
0	wells
0	;

0	it
0	is
0	probable
0	,
0	that
0	a
0	stream
0	of
0	water
0	,
0	in
0	a
0	subterraneous
0	chasm
0	or
0	crevice
0	,
0	coming
0	too
0	near
0	one
0	of
0	the
0	places
0	,
0	that
0	are
0	violently
0	heated
0	by
0	the
0	neighbouring
0	volcano
0	,
0	is
0	resolved
0	into
0	steams
0	;

0	and
0	forced
0	through
0	the
0	earth
0	and
0	stones
0	;

0	parts
0	of
0	it
0	however
0	seem
0	again
0	to
0	gather
0	somewhere
0	in
0	small
0	streams
0	,
0	oozing
0	out
0	at
0	the
0	hot
0	wells
0	,
0	close
0	to
0	the
0	sea-side
0	.

0	I
0	am
0	even
0	apt
0	to
0	believe
0	,
0	that
0	this
0	chasm
0	or
0	crevice
0	is
0	connected
0	with
0	the
0	crater
0	of
0	the
0	volcano
0	:
0	for
0	on
0	August
0	the
0	11th
0	,
0	when
0	the
0	volcano
0	was
0	heard
0	making
0	great
0	explosions
0	,
0	and
0	seen
0	throwing
0	up
0	very
0	large
0	masses
0	of
0	stones
0	,
0	ignited
0	ashes
0	,
0	and
0	immense
0	clouds
0	of
0	thick
0	smoke
0	,
0	we
0	observed
0	on
0	the
0	hill
0	,
0	that
0	at
0	each
0	explosion
0	,
0	there
0	came
0	new
0	quantities
0	of
0	steam
0	through
0	the
0	spiracula
0	.

0	At
0	the
0	bottom
0	of
0	the
0	harbour
0	near
0	the
0	beach
0	,
0	is
0	a
0	small
0	pond
0	containing
0	some
0	fresh
0	and
0	palatable
0	water
0	;

0	it
0	is
0	tinged
0	somewhat
0	brownish
0	and
0	though
0	perfectly
0	good
0	when
0	fresh
0	,
0	it
0	soon
0	contracted
0	in
0	the
0	casks
0	a
0	much
0	greater
0	degree
0	of
0	putrefaction
0	and
0	foetid
0	smell
0	,
0	than
0	had
0	been
0	observed
0	of
0	any
0	other
0	water
0	during
0	the
0	while
0	voyage
0	,
0	which
0	I
0	believe
0	proves
0	that
0	some
0	foreign
0	,
0	perhaps
0	inflammable
0	particles
0	are
0	contained
0	in
0	this
0	water
0	.

0	This
0	pond
0	was
0	connected
0	,
0	within
0	the
0	bushes
0	,
0	with
0	a
0	range
0	of
0	stagnant
0	,
0	muddy
0	waters
0	,
0	for

0	and
0	as
0	they

0	no

0	,
0	they
0	collect
0	in
0	the

0	of

0	,
0	the

0	,
0	and

0	belonging
0	to

0	this

0	,
0	New
0	Caledonia
0	and

PLACE-B	Hebrides
0	,
0	I
0	believe
0	the

0	to
0	be
0	true
0	:
0	for
0	all
0	these
0	lands
0	are
0	high

0	have
0	generally
0	bold
0	coasts

0	are
0	deep
0	close
0	into
0	the
0	shore
0	without
0	decreasing
0	.

0	I
0	have
0	however
0	in
0	some
0	instances
0	observed
0	just
0	the
0	contrary
0	;

0	as
0	off
0	the
0	South
0	entrance
0	of
PLACE-B	Dusky
PLACE-I	Bay
0	we
0	had
0	about
0	45
0	fathoms
0	water
0	;

0	but
0	in
0	the

0	itself
0	we
0	had
0	no

0	Off

0	between
PLACE-B	Cape
PLACE-I	Noir

PLACE-B	Christmas
PLACE-I	Bay
0	,
0	we
0	had
0	45
0	and
0	50
0	fathom
0	water
0	,
0	which
0	increased
0	to
0	60
0	or

0	;

0	but
0	when
0	we
0	stood
0	in
0	for
PLACE-B	Christmas
PLACE-I	Bay
0	we
0	had
0	no

0	,
0	in

0	When
0	we
0	were
0	off
0	the
0	coast
0	of
0	South
PLACE-B	Georgia
0	we
0	had
0	regular
0	soundings
0	,
0	but
0	in
0	the
0	entrance
0	of
PLACE-B	Possession
PLACE-I	Bay
0	we
0	had
0	no
0	ground
0	with
0	54
0	fathoms
0	.

0	According
0	to
0	the
0	above
0	rule
0	of
PERSON-B	Mr.
PERSON-B	de
PERSON-I	Buffon
0	,
0	the
0	low
0	isles
0	in
0	the
0	South-Seas
0	should
0	have
0	gradual
0	soundings
0	;

0	but
0	we
0	found
0	the
0	contrary
0	to
0	be
0	true
0	:
0	for
0	close
0	to
0	the
0	reef
0	forming
0	these
0	isles
0	,
0	the
0	water
0	is
0	almost
0	unfathomable
0	.

0	The
0	same
0	may
0	be
0	said
0	of
PLACE-B	O-Taheitee
0	and
0	all
0	the
PLACE-B	Society
PLACE-I	Isles
0	,
0	which
0	are
0	surrounded
0	by
0	a
0	fertile
0	plain
0	extending
0	from
0	the
0	hills
0	to
0	the
0	sea
0	,
0	and
0	then
0	included
0	in
0	a
0	reef
0	,
0	beyond
0	which
0	the
0	sea
0	immediately
0	becomes
0	excessively
0	deep
0	.

0	Near
PLACE-B	Turtle-Island
0	we
0	saw
0	an
0	oblong
0	reef
0	,
0	which
0	was
0	no
0	where
0	free
0	from
0	water
0	,
0	had
0	a
0	deep
0	sea
0	included
0	,
0	and
0	on
0	its
0	outsides
0	there
0	was
0	a
0	great
0	depth
0	close
0	to
0	the
0	reef
0	.

0	All
0	these
0	instances
0	here
0	enumerated
0	,
0	seem
0	to
0	be
0	exceptions
0	to
PERSON-B	Mr.
PERSON-B	de
PERSON-I	Buffon
0	's
0	rule
0	.

0	wherever
0	there
0	is
0	an
0	extensive
0	bank
0	or
0	shoal
0	,
0	there
0	the
0	colour
0	of
0	the
0	sea-water
0	is
0	changed
0	;

0	but
0	even
0	this
0	is
0	subject
0	to
0	many
0	exceptions
0	:
0	sometimes
0	we
0	find
0	places
0	which
0	are
0	amazingly
0	clear
0	,
0	and
0	the
0	ground
0	,
0	at
0	the
0	depth
0	of
0	several
0	fathoms
0	,
0	may
0	be
0	seen
0	as
0	plainly
0	as
0	if
0	it
0	were
0	within
0	a
0	few
0	yards
0	of
0	the
0	surface
0	;

0	sometimes
0	the
0	sea
0	assumes
0	a
0	grey
0	hue
0	,
0	and
0	seems
0	turbid
0	,
0	as
0	if
0	it
0	had
0	lost
0	its
0	limpidity
0	.

0	But
0	often
0	you
0	are
0	deceived
0	by
0	the
0	situation
0	of
0	the
0	sky
0	and
0	clouds
0	.

0	Dark
0	,
0	cloudy
0	weather
0	involves
0	likewise
0	the
0	whole
0	ocean
0	in
0	a
0	grey
0	hue
0	.

0	A
0	serene
0	and
0	clear
0	sky
0	tinges
0	the
0	waves
0	with
0	the
0	finest
0	berylline
0	or
0	blueish-green
0	colour
0	.

0	If
0	a
0	cloud
0	appears
0	,
0	it
0	gives
0	to
0	a
0	spot
0	of
0	the
0	sea
0	a
0	hue
0	quite
0	different
0	from
0	the
0	rest
0	;

0	and
0	,
0	if
0	not
0	well
0	attended
0	to
0	,
0	often
0	alarms
0	the
0	navigator
0	with
0	the
0	fear
0	of
0	soundings
0	,
0	or
0	even
0	shoals
0	.

0	A
0	judicious
0	eye
0	,
0	conducted
0	by
0	long
0	experience
0	,
0	can
0	alone
0	distinguish
0	properly
0	in
0	these
0	cases
0	.

0	But
0	,
0	upon
0	the
0	whole
0	,
0	it
0	cannot
0	be
0	too
0	much
0	recommended
0	to
0	navigators
0	,
0	especially
0	in
0	unexplored
0	seas
0	,
0	to
0	make
0	use
0	of
0	the
0	lead
0	in
0	every
0	doubtful
0	situation
0	.
0	*

0	It
0	has
0	been
0	suspected
0	,
0	that
0	the
0	saltness
0	of
0	the
0	ocean
0	is
0	not
0	every
0	where
0	equal
0	.

0	Some
0	assert
0	the
0	sea
0	to
0	be
0	salter
0	under
0	the
PLACE-B	Line
0	than
0	towards
0	the
0	Poles
0	;
0	=

0	that
0	the
0	great
0	oceans
0	are
0	salter
0	than
0	the
0	smaller
0	seas
0	,
0	which
0	are
0	almost
0	included
0	by
0	land
0	,
0	viz.
0	the
0	Baltic
0	,
0	the
PLACE-B	Mediterranean
0	,
0	the
0	White
0	Sea
0	near
0	Archangel
0	,
0	the
0	Persian
0	and
0	the
0	Arabic
0	Gulphs
0	,
0	etc
0	.
0	;

0	that
0	its
0	saltness
0	increases
0	with
0	its
0	large
0	depth
0	;

0	and
0	lastly
0	,
0	that
0	the
0	high
0	sea
0	,
0	at
0	a
0	great
0	distance
0	from
0	land
0	,
0	is
0	salter
0	than
0	near
0	it
0	,
0	and
0	especially
0	near
0	places
0	where
0	large
0	rivers
0	fall
0	into
0	the
0	sea
0	.

0	I
0	had
0	no
0	opportunity
0	to
0	make
0	the
0	necessary
0	experiments
0	to
0	ascertain
0	or
0	to
0	refute
0	these
0	assertions
0	,
0	as
0	I
0	was
0	obliged
0	to
0	set
0	out
0	upon
0	this
0	expedition
0	almost
0	at
0	a
0	moment
0	's
0	warning
0	,
0	and
0	could
0	not
0	therefore
0	provide
0	any
0	apparatus
0	necessary
0	for
0	that
0	purpose
0	.

0	The
0	above
0	remarks
0	may
0	,
0	however
0	,
0	serve
0	to
0	future
0	navigators
0	,
0	as
0	a
0	hint
0	of
0	what
0	is
0	still
0	wanted
0	to
0	be
0	observed
0	,
0	relative
0	to
0	the
0	saltness
0	of
0	the
0	ocean
0	.

0	I
0	should
0	therefore
0	propose
0	to
0	them
0	,
0	to
0	procure
0	the
0	apparatus
0	described
0	by
PERSON-B	Mr.

0	of
0	the

0	up
0	from

0	with
0	an
0	accurate
0	and
0	nice
0	hydrostatical
0	balance
0	,
0	in
0	order
0	to
0	ascertain
0	the
0	specific
0	gravity
0	of
0	any
0	water
0	or
0	liquid
0	;

0	or
0	they
0	may
0	make

0	,
0	for
0	convenience

0	,
0	of

0	into
0	which
0	a
0	tube
0	of
0	about
0	five

0	the

0	salt
0	,
0	are
0	marked
0	in
0	degrees

0	so
0	that
0	,
0	by
0	immersing
0	this
0	simple
0	machine
0	into
0	sea-water
0	,
0	it
0	would
0	be
0	easy
0	to
0	ascertain
0	the
0	degrees

0	This

0	the

0	,
0	the

0	which
0	communicated
0	to
0	it
0	a
0	kind
0	of
0	bitterness
0	,

0	When

0	of
PERSON-B	Dr.
PERSON-I	Irving
0	's
0	distilling
0	machine
0	,
0	we
0	likewise
0	found

0	that

0	thus
0	distilled
0	was
0	not
0	only
0	entirely
0	freed

0	,
0	besides

0	For

0	that

0	of

0	It
0	is
0	very

0	that

0	sometimes
0	a

0	a
0	more
0	philosophical

0	Many

0	=

0	Others
0	again
0	ascribe
0	it
0	to
0	the
0	great
0	number
0	of
0	animals
0	of
0	the
0	mollusca-tribe
0	,
0	swimming
0	every
0	where
0	in
0	the
0	sea
0	.

0	The
0	above-mentioned
0	shrimps
0	,
0	as
0	well
0	as
0	the
0	mollusca
0	,
0	may
0	contribute
0	to
0	make
0	the
0	sea
0	appear
0	luminous
0	;

0	but
0	I
0	would
0	not
0	venture
0	to
0	assert
0	these
0	to
0	be
0	the
0	only
0	causes
0	of
0	the
0	phosphoreal
0	light
0	,
0	after
0	the
0	observation
0	of
0	the
0	various
0	phaenomena
0	I
0	made
0	in
0	the
0	course
0	of
0	this
0	long
0	voyage
0	.

0	First
0	,
0	I
0	found
0	reason
0	to
0	doubt
0	,
0	whether
0	all
0	the
0	luminous
0	appearances
0	in
0	the
0	sea
0	are
0	of
0	the
0	same
0	nature
0	;

0	for
0	one
0	kind
0	of
0	these
0	phaenomena
0	never
0	extend
0	to
0	a
0	great
0	distance
0	from
0	the
0	ship
0	;

0	that
0	part
0	of
0	the
0	sea
0	only
0	appears
0	luminous
0	which
0	is
0	close
0	to
0	the
0	ship
0	,
0	and
0	the
0	light
0	is
0	likewise
0	communicated
0	only
0	to
0	the
0	top
0	of
0	the
0	next
0	waves
0	,
0	that
0	break
0	obliquely
0	from
0	it
0	;

0	and
0	this
0	happens
0	commonly
0	in
0	a
0	fresh
0	gale
0	.

0	Another
0	kind
0	of
0	phosphoreal
0	light
0	I
0	observed
0	commonly
0	in
0	,
0	or
0	immediately
0	succeeding
0	a
0	long
0	calm
0	,
0	after
0	hot
0	weather
0	;

0	it
0	spread
0	more
0	over
0	,
0	and
0	even
0	mixed
0	with
0	the
0	body
0	of
0	the
0	sea
0	,
0	than
0	the
0	former
0	.

0	When
0	we
0	took
0	the
0	sea-water
0	in
0	this
0	condition
0	into
0	a
0	tub
0	,
0	it
0	there
0	became
0	dark
0	as
0	soon
0	as
0	it
0	was
0	free
0	from
0	motion
0	:
0	but
0	,
0	at
0	each
0	violent
0	agitation
0	of
0	the
0	water
0	,
0	it
0	appeared
0	luminous
0	,
0	where
0	the
0	motion
0	was
0	produced
0	,
0	and
0	seemed
0	to
0	stick
0	for
0	a
0	moment
0	only
0	to
0	the
0	finger
0	or
0	hand
0	,
0	which
0	agitated
0	the
0	water
0	,
0	but
0	disappeared
0	as
0	instantaneously
0	.

0	The
0	third
0	kind
0	of
0	phosphoreal
0	light
0	is
0	no
0	doubt
0	caused
0	by
0	mollusca
0	,
0	*
0	whose
0	whole
0	figure
0	may
0	be
0	distinguished
0	in
0	the
0	water
0	by
0	their
0	own
0	luminous
0	appearance
0	.

0	I
0	have
0	observed
0	,
0	though
0	rarely
0	,
0	the
0	same
0	effect
0	to
0	be
0	occasioned
0	by
0	fish
0	and
0	shell-fish
0	;
0	=

0	and
0	there
0	may
0	be
0	likewise
0	some
0	shrimps
0	and
0	other
0	insects
0	,
0	×
0	that
0	are
0	phosphorescent
0	,
0	though
0	I
0	have
0	never
0	seen
0	them
0	.

0	But
0	the
0	most
0	singular
0	and
0	surprizing
0	appearance
0	of
0	this
0	nature
0	,
0	I
0	observed
0	in
0	the
0	night
0	preceding
0	Oct.
0	30
0	,
0	1772
0	,
0	when
0	we
0	were
0	off
0	the
PLACE-B	Cape
PLACE-I	of
PLACE-I	Good
PLACE-I	Hope
0	,
0	at
0	the
0	distance
0	of
0	a
0	few
0	miles
0	from
0	the
0	shore
0	,
0	and
0	had
0	a
0	fresh
0	gale
0	.

0	Scarcely
0	had
0	night
0	spread
0	its
0	veil
0	over
0	the
0	surface
0	of
0	the
0	ocean
0	,
0	when
0	it
0	had
0	the
0	apperance
0	of
0	being
0	all
0	over
0	on
0	fire
0	.

0	Every
0	wave
0	that
0	broke
0	had
0	a
0	luminous
0	margin
0	or
0	top
0	;

0	wherever
0	the
0	sides
0	of
0	the
0	ship
0	came
0	in
0	contact
0	with
0	the
0	sea
0	,
0	there
0	appeared
0	a
0	line
0	of
0	phosphoreal
0	light
0	.

0	The
0	eye
0	discovered
0	this
0	luminous
0	appearance
0	every
0	where
0	on
0	the
0	ocean
0	;

0	nay
0	,
0	the
0	very
0	bosom
0	of
0	this
0	immense
0	element
0	seemed
0	to
0	be
0	pregnant
0	with
0	this
0	shining
0	appearance
0	.

0	We
0	saw
0	great
0	bodies
0	illuminated
0	moving
0	in
0	the
0	sea
0	;

0	some
0	came
0	along-side
0	of
0	the
0	ship
0	,
0	and
0	stood
0	on
0	along
0	with
0	her
0	;

0	others
0	moved
0	off
0	from
0	her
0	with
0	a
0	velocity
0	almost
0	equal
0	to
0	lightning
0	.

0	The
0	shape
0	of
0	these
0	illuminated
0	bodies
0	discovered
0	them
0	to
0	be
0	fishes
0	.

0	Some
0	approached
0	near
0	one
0	another
0	,
0	and
0	when
0	a
0	small
0	one
0	came
0	near
0	a
0	larger
0	,
0	it
0	made
0	all
0	possible
0	haste
0	to
0	fly
0	from
0	the
0	danger
0	.

0	I
0	had
0	a
0	bucket
0	full
0	of
0	this
0	luminous
0	sea-water
0	drawn
0	up
0	for
0	examination
0	.

0	We
0	found
0	,
0	that
0	an
0	infinite
0	number
0	of
0	little
0	round
0	luminous
0	bodies
0	were
0	moving
0	in
0	the
0	water
0	with
0	amazing
0	quickness
0	.

0	After
0	the
0	water
0	had
0	been
0	standing
0	for
0	a
0	little
0	while
0	,
0	the
0	small
0	sparkling
0	objects
0	seemed
0	to
0	decrease
0	in
0	quantity
0	,
0	but
0	,
0	by
0	stirring
0	the
0	water
0	again
0	,
0	we
0	observed
0	the
0	whole
0	to
0	be
0	again
0	entirely
0	luminous
0	;

0	and
0	leaving
0	the
0	water
0	undisturbed
0	,
0	we
0	saw
0	the
0	little
0	sparks
0	moving
0	very
0	briskly
0	in
0	different
0	directions
0	.

0	Though
0	the
0	bucket
0	with
0	the
0	water
0	was
0	suspended
0	,
0	that
0	it
0	might
0	be
0	less
0	affected
0	by
0	the
0	motion
0	of
0	the
0	ship
0	,
0	the
0	sparkling
0	objects
0	still
0	moved
0	to
0	and
0	fro
0	'
0	,
0	so
0	that
0	this
0	first
0	convinced
0	me
0	,
0	that
0	these
0	luminous
0	atoms
0	had
0	a
0	voluntary
0	motion
0	,
0	quite
0	independent
0	of
0	the
0	agitation
0	of
0	the
0	water
0	or
0	ship
0	;

0	but
0	,
0	at
0	each
0	agitation
0	of
0	the
0	water
0	by
0	a
0	stick
0	or
0	the
0	hand
0	,
0	we
0	plainly
0	perceived
0	the
0	sparkling
0	to
0	increase
0	.

0	Sometimes
0	,
0	by
0	stirring
0	the
0	water
0	,
0	one
0	of
0	these
0	phosphoreal
0	sparks
0	would
0	stick
0	to
0	the
0	hand
0	or
0	finger
0	.

0	They
0	were
0	scarcely
0	of
0	the
0	size
0	of
0	the
0	smallest
0	pin
0	's
0	head
0	.

0	The
0	least
0	magnifier
0	of
0	my
0	microscope
0	discovered
0	these
0	little
0	atoms
0	to
0	be
0	globular
0	,
0	gelatinous
0	,
0	transparent
0	,
0	and
0	somewhat
0	brownish
0	.

0	By
0	putting
0	one
0	under
0	the
0	microscope
0	,
0	we
0	observed
0	first
0	a
0	kind
0	of
0	thin
0	tube
0	going
0	into
0	the
0	substance
0	of
0	this
0	little
0	globule
0	,
0	from
0	a
0	round
0	orifice
0	on
0	its
0	surface
0	.

0	The
0	inside
0	was
0	filled
0	with
0	four
0	or
0	five
0	oblong
0	intestine
0	bags
0	,
0	connected
0	with
0	the
0	tube
0	just
0	mentioned
0	.

0	The
0	same
0	appearances
0	were
0	observed
0	by
0	the
0	greatest
0	magnifier
0	,
0	and
0	were
0	only
0	more
0	distinct
0	.

0	I
0	wanted
0	to
0	examine
0	one
0	in
0	the
0	water
0	,
0	and
0	then
0	bring
0	it
0	under
0	the
0	microscope
0	,
0	but
0	I
0	could
0	not
0	provide
0	a
0	live
0	animalcule
0	:
0	they
0	were
0	all
0	dead
0	,
0	on
0	account
0	of
0	their
0	tender
0	structure
0	,
0	before
0	I
0	could
0	separate
0	them
0	from
0	the
0	finger
0	to
0	which
0	they
0	were
0	flicking
0	.

0	This
0	attempt
0	was
0	accordingly
0	frustrated
0	.

0	When
0	we
0	left
0	the
PLACE-B	Cape
PLACE-I	of
PLACE-I	Good
PLACE-I	Hope
0	,
0	on
0	November
0	the
0	22d
0	,
0	we
0	had
0	that
0	very
0	night
0	the
0	same
0	luminous
0	appearance
0	of
0	the
0	sea
0	,
0	and
0	a
0	very
0	hard
0	gale
0	.

0	Thus
0	we
0	have
0	again
0	a
0	new
0	cause
0	of
0	the
0	phosphoreal
0	light
0	.

0	But
0	,
0	before
0	we
0	proceed
0	with
0	our
0	remarks
0	,
0	let
0	us
0	only
0	follow
0	the
0	idea
0	arising
0	from
0	this
0	phaenomenon
0	.

0	The
0	immense
0	ocean
0	,
0	filled
0	with
0	myriads
0	of
0	animalcules
0	,
0	which
0	have
0	life
0	,
0	loco-motion
0	,
0	and
0	a
0	power
0	of
0	shining
0	in
0	the
0	dark
0	,
0	of
0	laying
0	that
0	power
0	aside
0	at
0	pleasure
0	,
0	and
0	illuminating
0	all
0	bodies
0	coming
0	in
0	contact
0	with
0	them
0	;

0	this
0	is
0	a
0	wonder
0	which
0	fills
0	the
0	mind
0	with
0	greater
0	astonishment
0	and
0	reverential
0	awe
0	,
0	than
0	it
0	is
0	in
0	my
0	power
0	justly
0	and
0	properly
0	to
0	describe
0	.

0	If
0	I
0	were
0	now
0	to
0	say
0	something
0	on
0	the
0	different
0	species
0	of
0	phosphoreal
0	light
0	,
0	I
0	could
0	by
0	no
0	means
0	give
0	my
0	assertion
0	,
0	that
0	degree
0	of
0	certainty
0	with
0	philosophers
0	would
0	require
0	.

0	I
0	will
0	therefore
0	confine
0	myself
0	to
0	some
0	probable
0	hints
0	concerning
0	their
0	real
0	causes
0	.

0	The
0	first
0	species
0	of
0	luminous
0	appearance
0	seems
0	to
0	be
0	produced
0	by
0	a
0	cause
0	altogether
0	different
0	from
0	the
0	rest
0	,
0	and
0	if
0	I
0	may
0	venture
0	to
0	declare
0	my
0	opinion
0	on
0	the
0	subject
0	,
0	I
0	should
0	think
0	,
0	that
0	this
0	light
0	is
0	owing
0	to
0	electricity
0	.

0	We
0	know
0	very
0	well
0	,
0	that
0	the
0	motion
0	of
0	a
0	ship
0	through
0	the
0	water
0	in
0	a
0	gale
0	,
0	is
0	extremely
0	swift
0	,
0	and
0	the
0	friction
0	caused
0	by
0	this
0	motion
0	very
0	great
0	:
0	for
0	we
0	find
0	that
0	the
0	sea
0	agitated
0	by
0	a
0	gale
0	of
0	wind
0	is
0	remarkably
0	warmer
0	,
0	than
0	the
0	air
0	.
0	*

0	The
0	bituminous
0	substances
0	,
0	which
0	cover
0	the
0	sides
0	of
0	ships
0	,
0	the
0	nails
0	sticking
0	in
0	the
0	bottom
0	,
0	and
0	the
0	conducting
0	power
0	of
0	water
0	will
0	equally
0	serve
0	to
0	explain
0	the
0	possibility
0	of
0	such
0	an
0	electricity
0	.

0	The
0	second
0	species
0	of
0	luminous
0	appearance
0	in
0	sea
0	water
0	seems
0	to
0	be
0	a
0	real
0	phosphoreal
0	light
0	.

0	It
0	is
0	very
0	well
0	known
0	,
0	that
0	many
0	animal
0	bodies
0	putrify
0	and
0	are
0	dissolved
0	in
0	the
0	sea
0	,
0	and
0	that
0	almost
0	every
0	part
0	of
0	animal
0	and
0	many
0	mineral
0	bodies
0	,
0	and
0	the
0	air
0	itself
0	,
0	contains
0	the
0	acid
0	of
0	phosphorus
0	as
0	an
0	integrant
0	part
0	.
0	=

0	The
0	addition
0	of
0	any
0	inflammable
0	principle
0	to
0	this
0	acid
0	,
0	will
0	produce
0	the
0	substance
0	we
0	call
0	phosphorus
0	.

0	Every
0	one
0	who
0	has
0	seen
0	salted
0	fish
0	drying
0	,
0	must
0	know
0	that
0	many
0	of
0	them
0	become
0	phosphoreal
0	.

0	It
0	is
0	likewise
0	a
0	well
0	established
0	fact
0	,
0	that
0	the
0	ocean
0	,
0	itself
0	after
0	a
0	long
0	continued
0	calm
0	,
0	becomes
0	stinking
0	and
0	highly
0	putrid
0	,
0	×
0	arising
0	probably
0	from
0	the
0	putrefaction
0	of
0	a
0	great
0	many
0	animal
0	substances
0	,
0	that
0	die
0	in
0	the
0	ocean
0	,
0	float
0	in
0	it
0	,
0	and
0	in
0	hot
0	calm
0	days
0	frequently
0	and
0	suddenly
0	putrefy
0	.

0	That
0	fishes
0	and
0	mollusca
0	contain
0	oily
0	and
0	inflammable
0	particles
0	is
0	equally
0	well
0	known
0	.

0	The
0	acid
0	of
0	phosphorus
0	disengaged
0	by
0	putrefaction
0	from
0	its
0	original
0	mixture
0	in
0	animal
0	bodies
0	,
0	may
0	easily
0	combine
0	with
0	some
0	of
0	the
0	just
0	mentioned
0	inflammables
0	,
0	and
0	thus
0	produce
0	a
0	phosphorus
0	floating
0	on
0	the
0	top
0	of
0	the
0	ocean
0	,
0	and
0	causing
0	that
0	luminous
0	appearance
0	,
0	which
0	we
0	so
0	much
0	admire
0	.

0	Lastly
0	the
0	third
0	kind
0	of
0	phosphoreal
0	light
0	no
0	doubt
0	arises
0	from
0	live
0	animals
0	floating
0	in
0	the
0	sea
0	and
0	is
0	owing
0	to
0	their
0	peculiar
0	structure
0	or
0	rather
0	the
0	nature
0	of
0	their
0	integrant
0	parts
0	,
0	which
0	perhaps
0	might
0	be
0	investigated
0	,
0	by
0	analyzing
0	chemically
0	some
0	of
0	the
0	mollusca
0	,
0	which
0	have
0	a
0	luminous
0	appearance
0	.

0	A
0	Suspicion
0	was
0	long
0	since
0	entertained
0	by
0	the
0	author
0	of
0	the
0	Universal
0	History
0	,
0	and
0	by
0	the
0	learned
0	and
0	ingenious
0	President
0	des
0	Brosses
0	,
0	*
0	of
0	a
0	great
0	Southern
0	continent
0	,
0	founded
0	on
0	the
0	argument
0	,
0	that
0	in
0	case
0	there
0	should
0	be
0	no
0	more
0	land
0	in
0	the
0	Southern
0	hemisphere
0	,
0	than
0	what
0	we
0	knew
0	before
0	,
0	it
0	would
0	be
0	insufficient
0	to
0	counterpoise
0	the
0	weight
0	of
0	lands
0	in
0	the
0	Northern
0	.

0	An
0	ingenious
0	author
0	,
0	whose
0	disinterested
0	zeal
0	for
0	the
0	promotion
0	of
0	geography
0	,
0	navigation
0	and
0	discoveries
0	is
0	not
0	less
0	conspicuous
0	,
0	than
0	his
0	many
0	virtues
0	as
0	a
0	man
0	,
0	a
0	citizen
0	and
0	a
0	friend
0	,
0	has
0	lately
0	=
0	endeavoured
0	to
0	set
0	these
0	arguments
0	in
0	a
0	stronger
0	light
0	.

0	Our
0	present
0	circumnavigation
0	has
0	,
0	I
0	believe
0	,
0	put
0	it
0	beyond
0	doubt
0	,
0	that
0	there
0	is
0	no
0	land
0	on
0	this
0	side
0	of
0	60
0	°
0	in
0	the
0	Southern
0	hemisphere
0	,
0	if
0	we
0	except
0	the
0	few
0	inconsiderable
0	fragments
0	we
0	found
0	in
0	the
0	Southern
0	atlantic
0	ocean
0	.

0	If
0	therefore
0	we
0	should
0	even
0	suppose
0	,
0	that
0	the
0	whole
0	space
0	from
0	60
0	°
0	and
0	upwards
0	,
0	where
0	we
0	have
0	not
0	been
0	,
0	be
0	intirely
0	occupied
0	by
0	land
0	,
0	this
0	would
0	be
0	still
0	too
0	inconsiderable
0	to
0	counterpoise
0	the
0	lands
0	of
0	the
0	Northern
0	hemisphere
0	.

0	I
0	am
0	therefore
0	apt
0	to
0	suspect
0	,
0	that
0	nature
0	has
0	provided
0	against
0	this
0	defect
0	,
0	by
0	placing
0	perhaps
0	at
0	the
0	bottom
0	of
0	the
0	Southern
0	ocean
0	such
0	bodies
0	as
0	by
0	their
0	specific
0	weight
0	will
0	compensate
0	the
0	deficiency
0	of
0	lands
0	;

0	if
0	this
0	system
0	of
0	the
0	wanted
0	counterpoise
0	be
0	at
0	all
0	necessary
0	.

0	But
0	there
0	may
0	perhaps
0	be
0	other
0	methods
0	to
0	obviate
0	this
0	defect
0	,
0	of
0	which
0	our
0	narrow
0	knowledge
0	and
0	experience
0	have
0	not
0	yet
0	informed
0	us
0	.

0	NOTHING
0	appeared
0	more
0	strange
0	to
0	the
0	several
0	navigators
0	in
0	high
0	latitudes
0	,
0	than
0	the
0	first
0	sight
0	of
0	the
0	immense
0	masses
0	of
0	ice
0	which
0	are
0	found
0	floating
0	in
0	the
0	ocean
0	;

0	and
0	I
0	must
0	confess
0	,
0	that
0	though
0	I
0	had
0	read
0	a
0	great
0	many
0	accounts
0	on
0	their
0	nature
0	,
0	figure
0	,
0	formation
0	and
0	magnitude
0	,
0	I
0	was
0	however
0	very
0	much
0	struck
0	by
0	their
0	first
0	appearance
0	.

0	The
0	real
0	grandeur
0	of
0	the
0	sight
0	by
0	far
0	surpassed
0	any
0	thing
0	I
0	could
0	expect
0	;

0	for
0	we
0	saw
0	sometimes
0	islands
0	of
0	ice
0	of
0	one
0	or
0	two
0	miles
0	extent
0	,
0	and
0	at
0	the
0	same
0	time
0	a
0	hundred
0	feet
0	or
0	upwards
0	above
0	water
0	.

0	We
0	will
0	suppose
0	,
0	that
0	ice
0	of
0	parallel
0	dimensions
0	swimming
0	in
0	sea-water
0	,
0	only
0	shews
0	one
0	part
0	out
0	of
0	ten
0	above
0	water
0	;
0	=

0	which
0	is
0	a
0	moderate
0	supposition
0	,
0	because
0	according
0	to
PERSON-B	Mairan
0	×
0	ice
0	swimming
0	in
0	fresh
0	water
0	had
0	one
0	fourteenth
0	part
0	of
0	the
0	whole
0	above
0	its
0	surface
0	;
