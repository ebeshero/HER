0	All

0	directed

0	to
0	the
0	N.
0	E.
0	quarter
0	,
0	and
0	about
0	noon
0	arrived
0	at
0	a
0	neck
0	of
0	land
0	,
0	over
0	which
0	they
0	were
0	to
0	travel
0	on
0	foot
0	to
0	come
0	at
0	the
0	place
0	where
0	the
0	turtle
0	were
0	supposed
0	to
0	harbour
0	,
0	and
0	where
0	it
0	was
0	dangerous
0	to
0	attempt
0	to
0	approach
0	them
0	by
0	sea
0	by
0	reason
0	of
0	the
0	surf
0	.

0	Here
0	they
0	safely
0	secured
0	their
0	cutter
0	,
0	and
0	near
0	the
0	shore
0	they
0	erected
0	a
0	kind
0	of
0	hut
0	,
0	to
0	which
0	they
0	carried
0	their
0	provisions
0	,
0	and
0	sat
0	down
0	to
0	rest
0	and
0	to
0	refresh
0	.

0	This
0	done
0	,
0	they
0	agreed
0	to
0	divide
0	,
0	and
0	to
0	pursue
0	their
0	sport
0	in
0	separate
0	parties
0	.

0	Accordingly
0	they
0	set
0	out
0	,
0	and
0	before
0	the
0	next
0	morning
0	they
0	had
0	sent
0	in
0	as
0	many
0	turtle
0	as
0	the
0	cutter
0	could
0	well
0	stow
0	.

0	This
0	they
0	did
0	by
0	placing
0	them
0	across
0	a
0	couple
0	of
0	oars
0	in
0	the
0	nature
0	of
0	a

0	,
0	and
0	keeping
0	men
0	employed
0	in
0	conveying
0	them
0	from
0	the
0	place
0	where
0	they
0	were
0	turned
0	,
0	to
0	the
0	cutter
0	.

0	As
0	they
0	grew
0	tired
0	of
0	their
0	diversion
0	,
0	they
0	repaired
0	to
0	the
0	place
0	of
0	rendezvous
0	;

0	but
0	it
0	was
0	some
0	surprize
0	to
0	the
0	rest
0	,
0	when

0	and
0	Simeon
0	Woodrooff
0	,
0	the
0	gunner
0	's
0	mate
0	,
0	was
0	missing
0	.

0	It
0	was
0	then
0	concluded
0	that
0	they
0	had
0	gone
0	too
0	far
0	within
0	land
0	,
0	and
0	that
0	they
0	had
0	either
0	lost
0	their
0	way
0	,
0	or
0	some
0	accident
0	had
0	befallen
0	them
0	;

0	perhaps
0	from
0	natives
0	lurking
0	secretly
0	in
0	the
0	woods
0	,
0	though
0	none
0	had
0	openly
0	appeared
0	.

0	Under
0	these
0	apprehensions
0	two
0	seamen
0	,
0	Bartholomew
0	Loremer
0	and
0	Thomas
0	Trecher
0	were
0	sent
0	out
0	in
0	search
0	of
0	them
0	,
0	each
0	carrying
0	a
0	gallon
0	of
0	water
0	,
0	with
0	brandy
0	and
0	other
0	refreshments
0	,
0	in
0	case
0	they
0	should
0	meet
0	with
0	the
0	Gentlemenn
0	their
0	way
0	.

0	In
0	a
0	wild
0	uncultivated

0	,
0	over-run

0	close

0	,
0	the

0	,
0	who
0	has
0	never
0	been
0	bewildered
0	in
0	a

0	lost
0	in
0	the

0	.

0	So
0	,
0	however
0	it
0	happened
0	.

0	The
0	Gentlemen
0	,
0	invited
0	by
0	the
0	mixed
0	melody
0	of
0	the
0	birds
0	in
0	the
0	woods
0	,
0	left
0	these
0	people
0	as
0	soon
0	as
0	they

0	properly

0	them
0	,
0	n
0	=

0	181
0	"
0	/

0	and
0	entered
0	an
0	adjoining
0	thicket
0	,
0	with
0	their
0	guns
0	.

0	The
0	sport
0	they
0	met
0	with
0	led
0	them
0	on
0	till
0	night
0	began
0	to
0	close
0	upon
0	them
0	.

0	They
0	were
0	then
0	at
0	a
0	distance
0	from
0	the
0	turtlers
0	,
0	and
0	in
0	the

0	a

0	,
0	with
0	nothing
0	but
0	lew
0	trees
0	to
0	direct
0	their
0	return
0	;

0	but
0	what
0	was
0	more
0	alarming
0	,
0	the
0	sun
0	was
0	no
0	sooner
0	set
0	,
0	than
0	a
0	thick
0	fog
0	succeeded
0	,
0	which
0	involved
0	the
0	woods
0	in
0	darkness
0	,
0	though
0	the
0	open
0	beach
0	remained
0	clear
0	.

0	In
0	vain
0	they
0	attempted
0	to

0	;

0	for
0	,
0	instead
0	,
0	of

0	to

0	the
0	trees
0	they

0	marked
0	to
0	secure
0	their

0	,
0	they
0	could
0	hardly
0	see
0	one

0	at
0	five

0	.

0	In
0	this

0	,
0	they
0	soon
0	began
0	to
0	lose
0	all
0	knowledge
0	of
0	their
0	way
0	;

0	and
0	lest
0	,
0	instead
0	of
0	proceeding
0	in
0	the
0	right
0	course
0	,
0	they
0	should
0	pursue
0	a
0	contrary
0	direction
0	,
0	they
0	agreed
0	to
0	sit
0	down
0	to
0	rest
0	,
0	and
0	for
0	that
0	purpose
0	chose
0	the
0	first
0	convenient
0	spot
0	that
0	chance
0	threw
0	in
0	their
0	way
0	.

0	Though
0	their
0	minds
0	were
0	troubled
0	,
0	they
0	had
0	scarce
0	set
0	themselves
0	down
0	,
0	when
0	sleep
0	got
0	the
0	better
0	of
0	their
0	anxiety
0	,
0	and
0	they
0	all
0	lay
0	composed
0	till
0	attacked
0	by
0	swarms
0	of
0	black
0	ants
0	,
0	(
0	creatures
0	more
0	poisonous
0	than
0	bugs
0	)
0	with
0	which
0	they
0	were
0	in
0	a
0	manner
0	covered
0	when
0	they
0	awoke
0	;

0	and
0	so
0	disfigured
0	and
0	tormented
0	with
0	their
0	bites
0	and
0	blisters
0	,
0	that
0	it
0	is
0	hardly
0	possible
0	to
0	desribe
0	their
0	distress
0	.

0	Thus
0	circumstanced
0	,
0	their
0	first
0	care
0	was
0	to
0	clear
0	themselves
0	from
0	these
0	vermin
0	,
0	by
0	stripping
0	themselves
0	,
0	and
0	sweeping
0	them
0	off
0	with
0	brushes
0	made
0	of
0	the
0	wings
0	of
0	the
0	birds
0	they
0	had
0	killed
0	;

0	this
0	done
0	,
0	they
0	clothed
0	themselves
0	again
0	,
0	in
0	order
0	to
0	renew
0	their
0	atttempts
0	to
0	recover
0	the
0	shore
0	;

0	but
0	all
0	in
0	vain
0	.

0	The
0	farther
0	they
0	walked
0	,
0	as
0	it
0	appeared
0	afterwards
0	,
0	the
0	farther
0	they
0	went
0	astray
0	.

0	At
0	length
0	,
0	suspecting
0	their
0	error
0	,
0	they
0	resolved
0	to
0	remain
0	stationary
0	;

0	and
0	each
0	man
0	,
0	placing
0	himself
0	against
0	an
0	adjoining
0	tree
0	,
0	endeavoured
0	to
0	console
0	himself
0	as
0	well
0	as
0	he
0	could
0	till
0	morning
0	,
0	when
0	the
0	appearance
0	of
0	the
0	sun
0	should
0	enable
0	them
0	to
0	judge
0	of
0	the
0	course
0	they
0	were
0	to
0	pursue
0	;

0	but
0	in
0	a
0	trackless
0	wilderness
0	how
0	were
0	they
0	to
0	make
0	their
0	way
0	!

0	The
0	thicket
0	in
0	many
0	places
0	was
0	overgrown
0	with
0	thick
0	grass
0	and
0	brambles
0	reaching
0	;

0	to
0	their
0	middles
0	,
0	and
0	in
0	others
0	so
0	thick
0	intersected
0	with
0	boughs
0	,
0	and
0	matted
0	with
0	leaves
0	,
0	that
0	it
0	was
0	hardly
0	possible
0	to
0	keep
0	company
0	,
0	or
0	to
0	penetrate
0	with
0	their
0	utmost
0	efforts
0	,
0	when
0	these
0	obstructions
0	happened
0	)
0	one
0	hundred
0	yards
0	in
0	as
0	many
0	minutes
0	.

0	Still
0	,
0	however
0	,
0	labouring
0	to
0	advance
0	,
0	they
0	,
0	at
0	length
0	,
0	all
0	at
0	once
0	,
0	observed
0	an
0	opening
0	that
0	led
0	,
0	as
0	they
0	thought
0	,
0	to
0	the
0	long-wished
0	for
0	shore
0	.

0	They
0	forgot
0	,
0	for
0	the
0	moment
0	,
0	the
0	pains
0	of
0	their
0	lacerated
0	limbs
0	,
0	though
0	all
0	torn
0	with
0	briars
0	and
0	besmeared
0	with
0	blood
0	,
0	and
0	comforted
0	themselves
0	with
0	the
0	hope
0	of
0	a
0	speedy
0	deliverance
0	.

0	But
0	they
0	had
0	still
0	a
0	journey
0	of
0	about
0	seven
0	or
0	eight
0	miles
0	to
0	perform
0	,
0	before
0	they
0	could
0	reach
0	the
0	place
0	from
0	whence
0	they
0	set
0	out
0	.

0	Almost
0	spent
0	with
0	fatigue
0	,
0	and
0	their
0	spirits
0	wasted
0	with
0	the
0	most
0	painful
0	exertion
0	of
0	bodily
0	strength
0	,
0	without
0	having
0	a
0	drop
0	of
0	water
0	to
0	quench
0	their
0	intolerable
0	thirst
0	,
0	they
0	at
0	length
0	arrived
0	at
0	the
0	hut
0	,
0	when
0	,
0	to
0	their
0	great
0	mortification
0	,
0	they
0	found
0	it
0	deserted
0	,
0	and
0	destitute
0	of
0	every
0	kind
0	of
0	refreshment
0	.

0	In
0	this
0	situation
0	casting
0	their
0	eyes
0	towards
0	the
0	ships
0	,
0	they
0	perceived
0	the
0	boats
0	hastening
0	to
0	their
0	relief
0	.

0	The
0	officer
0	who
0	commanded
0	,
0	and
0	the
0	crew
0	,
0	had
0	waited
0	at
0	the
0	hut
0	till
0	all
0	their
0	provisions
0	were
0	expended
0	,
0	and
0	the
0	officer
0	not
0	knowing
0	how
0	to
0	proceed
0	,
0	had
0	repaired
0	to
0	the
0	ship
0	for
0	a
0	fresh
0	supply
0	,
0	and
0	for
0	fresh
0	orders
0	,
0	and
0	was
0	now
0	returning
0	fully
0	furnished
0	and
0	instructed
0	.

0	On
0	his
0	arrival
0	he
0	was
0	struck
0	with
0	astonishment
0	at
0	the
0	sight
0	of
0	three
0	such
0	miserable
0	beings
0	,
0	as
0	the
0	Gentlemen
0	and
0	Mate
0	appeared
0	to
0	be
0	,
0	lacerated
0	all
0	over
0	,
0	and
0	besmeared
0	with
0	blood
0	,
0	and
0	with
0	scarce
0	a
0	rag
0	about
0	them
0	broader
0	than
0	a
0	garter
0	.

0	Their
0	cry
0	was
0	for
0	grog
0	,
0	which
0	was
0	dealt
0	to
0	them
0	sparingly
0	,
0	and
0	they
0	were
0	instantly
0	sent
0	on
0	board
0	to
0	be
0	properly
0	taken
0	care
0	of
0	.

0	The
0	first
0	enquiry
0	they
0	made
0	,
0	was
0	,
0	whether
0	any
0	of
0	the
0	company
0	had
0	been
0	sent
0	after
0	them
0	;

0	and
0	being
0	answered
0	in
0	the
0	affirmative
0	,
0	and
0	that
0	they
0	were
0	not
0	yet
0	returned
0	,
0	they
0	could
0	not
0	help
0	expressing
0	their
0	doubts
0	whether
0	they
0	ever
0	would
0	return
0	;

0	adding
0	their
0	wishes
0	at
0	the
0	same
0	time
0	,
0	that
0	no
0	means
0	might
0	be
0	omitted
0	to
0	endeavour
0	their
0	recovery
0	.

0	It
0	is
0	natural
0	for
0	men
0	,
0	who
0	have
0	just
0	experienced
0	any
0	signal
0	deliverance
0	,
0	to
0	feel
0	poignantly
0	for
0	the
0	safety
0	of
0	others
0	under
0	the
0	same
0	critical
0	circumstances
0	.

0	It
0	was
0	therefore
0	no
0	small
0	satisfaction
0	to
0	the
0	sufferers
0	,
0	when
0	they
0	were
0	told
0	,
0	that
0	every
0	possible
0	means
0	would
0	be
0	tried
0	for
0	the
0	poor
0	men
0	's
0	relief
0	;

0	and
0	to
0	enable
0	those
0	who
0	were
0	to
0	be
0	sent
0	on
0	that
0	errand
0	the
0	better
0	to
0	direct
0	their
0	search
0	,
0	the
0	gentlemen
0	described
0	,
0	as
0	well
0	as
0	they
0	could
0	,
0	the
0	spot
0	where
0	they
0	thought
0	they
0	heard
0	men
0	halloo
0	to
0	one
0	another
0	about
0	the
0	dawn
0	of
0	day
0	.

0	There
0	were
0	now
0	twenty
0	of
0	the
0	crew
0	(
0	seamen
0	and
0	marines
0	)
0	who
0	had
0	been
0	dispatched
0	from
0	on
0	board
0	,
0	for
0	recovering
0	the
0	gentlemen
0	.

0	These
0	had
0	orders
0	to
0	traverse
0	the
0	thickets
0	in
0	a
0	body
0	,
0	till
0	they
0	should
0	find
0	one
0	or
0	other
0	of
0	them
0	,
0	either
0	living
0	or
0	dead
0	;

0	for
0	,
0	till
0	the
0	gentlemen
0	appeared
0	,
0	nothing
0	could
0	be
0	concluded
0	with
0	certainty
0	concerning
0	them
0	.

0	The
0	majority
0	were
0	of
0	opinion
0	,
0	that
0	,
0	if
0	they
0	had
0	been
0	alive
0	,
0	they
0	most
0	certainly
0	would
0	have
0	returned
0	as
0	soon
0	as
0	it
0	was
0	dark
0	,
0	as
0	they
0	could
0	have
0	no
0	motive
0	to
0	pursue
0	their
0	sport
0	in
0	the
0	night
0	;

0	and
0	it
0	was
0	by
0	no
0	means
0	probable
0	,
0	that
0	they
0	should
0	be
0	bewildered
0	,
0	because
0	they
0	might
0	surely
0	have
0	found
0	the
0	same
0	way
0	out
0	of
0	the
0	cover
0	,
0	by
0	which
0	they
0	went
0	into
0	it
0	.

0	This
0	was
0	very
0	plausible
0	;

0	but
0	〈
0	◊
0	〉
0	on
0	board
0	,
0	who
0	had
0	sailed
0	with
0	Commodore
PERSON-B	Byron
0	,
0	and
0	who
0	remembered
0	the
0	almost
0	impenetrable
0	thickets
0	in
0	the
0	island
0	of
PLACE-B	Tinian
0	,
0	where
0	men
0	could
0	not
0	see
0	one
0	another
0	in
0	open
0	day
0	,
0	at
0	the
0	distance
0	of
0	five
0	yards
0	,
0	knew
0	well
0	how
0	the

0	might
0	be
0	entangled

0	how

0	it
0	would
0	fare
0	with
0	them
0	if
0	it
0	should
0	so
0	happen
0	.

0	But
0	,
0	as
0	this
0	instance
0	was
0	known
0	only
0	to
0	few
0	,
0	it
0	was
0	regarded
0	by
0	none
0	;

0	and
0	the
0	former
0	opinion
0	,
0	that
0	some
0	fatal
0	accident
0	had
0	happened
0	to

0	,
0	prevailed

0	till

0	,
0	when
0	the

0	Early

0	of

0	:
0	and

0	line
0	of

0	towards
0	the
0	spot
0	where
0	the

0	was
0	heard
0	by

0	.

0	After
0	a
0	diligent
0	search
0	of
0	six
0	hours
0	,
0	Bartholomew
0	Loreman
0	was
0	discovered
0	in
0	a
0	most
0	miserable
0	condition
0	,
0	almost
0	blinded
0	by
0	the
0	venomous
0	bites
0	of
0	vermin
0	,
0	added
0	to
0	the
0	scorching
0	heat
0	of
0	the
0	sun
0	,
0	and
0	speechless
0	for
0	want
0	of
0	something
0	to
0	clear
0	his
0	throat
0	.

0	He
0	made
0	signs
0	for
0	water
0	,
0	and
0	water
0	was
0	given
0	him
0	.

0	He
0	had
0	got
0	out
0	of
0	the
0	thicket
0	,
0	and
0	was
0	wandering
0	about
0	upon
0	the
0	beech
0	,
0	without
0	being
0	sensible
0	of
0	the
0	miserable
0	condition
0	in
0	which
0	he
0	was
0	found
0	.

0	It
0	fortunately
0	happened
0	,
0	that
0	a
0	boat
0	from

0	the

0	;

0	and
0	it
0	was
0	with
0	the
0	utmost
0	difficulty
0	that
0	he
0	was
0	carried
0	to
0	the
0	nearest
0	boat
0	.

0	As
0	soon
0	as
0	he
0	could
0	be
0	brought
0	to
0	his
0	speech
0	,
0	he
0	said
0	he
0	had
0	parted
0	from
0	his
0	companion
0	Trecher
0	in
0	the
0	morning
0	,
0	not
0	in
0	anger
0	,
0	but
0	not
0	agreeing
0	about
0	the
0	way
0	back
0	,
0	nor
0	ever
0	expecting
0	to
0	see
0	one
0	another
0	again
0	.

0	They
0	had
0	traversed
0	the
0	thicket
0	as
0	long
0	as
0	they
0	were
0	able
0	,
0	in
0	search
0	of
0	the
0	gentlemen
0	without
0	success
0	;

0	and
0	when
0	overcome
0	with
0	fatigue
0	,
0	they
0	sat
0	down
0	to
0	refresh
0	,
0	and
0	he
0	believed
0	had
0	drank
0	a
0	little
0	too
0	freely
0	of
0	the
0	grog
0	they
0	had
0	in
0	charge
0	,
0	for
0	they
0	both
0	fell
0	asleep
0	.

0	They
0	were
0	frightened
0	when
0	they
0	waked
0	to
0	find
0	it
0	dark
0	night
0	;

0	and
0	although
0	they
0	felt
0	their
0	faces
0	and
0	hands
0	covered
0	with
0	vermin
0	,
0	the
0	thoughts
0	of
0	having
0	neglected
0	their
0	duty
0	,
0	and
0	the
0	dread
0	of
0	the
0	consequences
0	so
0	distracted
0	their
0	minds
0	,
0	that
0	they
0	were
0	hardly
0	sensible
0	of
0	any
0	other
0	pain
0	.

0	As
0	rest
0	was
0	now
0	no
0	longer
0	their
0	object
0	,
0	they
0	rose
0	and
0	wandered
0	,
0	they
0	neither
0	knew
0	nor
0	cared
0	where
0	,
0	till
0	day
0	began
0	to
0	break
0	upon
0	them
0	.

0	In
0	the
0	mean
0	time
0	,
0	several
0	wild
0	projects
0	came
0	into
0	their
0	heads
0	.

0	At
0	last
0	they
0	thought
0	of
0	climbing
0	the
0	highest
0	tree
0	,
0	to
0	try
0	if
0	they
0	could
0	discover
0	any
0	hill
0	or
0	eminence
0	,
0	from
0	whence
0	they
0	might
0	take
0	a
0	view
0	of
0	the
0	country
0	,
0	in
0	order
0	to
0	be
0	certain
0	whether
0	it
0	was
0	inhabited
0	or
0	not
0	.

0	This
0	was
0	approved
0	of
0	by
0	both
0	,
0	and
0	Trecher
0	mounted
0	the
0	loftiest
0	within
0	his
0	reach
0	,
0	from
0	whence
0	he
0	said
0	he
0	could
0	discern
0	,
0	towards
0	the
0	South-west
0	,
0	a
0	hill
0	of
0	considerable
0	height
0	;

0	and
0	as
0	that
0	was
0	,
0	as
0	he
0	thought
0	,
0	the
0	point
0	that
0	led
0	to
0	the
0	shore
0	,
0	thither
0	he
0	proposed
0	that
0	they
0	should
0	go
0	;

0	but
0	Loreman
0	rather
0	chose
0	to
0	endeavour
0	to
0	regain
0	the
0	shore
0	by
0	another
0	course
0	;

0	and
0	as
0	he
0	thought
0	he
0	heard
0	the
0	report
0	of
0	a
0	gun
0	the
0	evening
0	before
0	,
0	he
0	determined
0	to
0	make
0	towards
0	the
0	point
0	from
0	whence
0	the
PLACE-B	sound
0	proceeded
0	;

0	and
0	in
0	that
0	he
0	happened
0	to
0	judge
0	right
0	;

0	and
0	when
0	he
0	got
0	out
0	of
0	the
0	wood
0	,
0	being
0	parched
0	with
0	thirst
0	,
0	he
0	killed
0	a
0	turtle
0	and
0	sucked
0	the
0	blood
0	.

0	His
0	companion
0	,
0	he
0	said
0	,
0	who
0	was
0	at
0	some
0	distance
0	farther
0	in
0	the
0	thicket
0	,
0	and
0	who
0	did
0	not
0	hear
0	the
0	report
0	of
0	the
0	gun
0	,
0	did
0	not
0	believe
0	what
0	he
0	said
0	;

0	whereupon
0	they
0	agreed
0	to
0	part
0	.

0	What
0	course
0	Trecher
0	took
0	he
0	could
0	not
0	tell
0	,
0	but
0	he
0	believed
0	to
0	the
0	South-west
0	.

0	Loreman
0	was
0	judged
0	in
0	too
0	dangerous
0	a
0	condition
0	to
0	admit
0	of
0	any
0	delay
0	;

0	he
0	was
0	therefore
0	sent
0	off
0	in
0	the
0	boat
0	,
0	and
0	being
0	put
0	under
0	the
0	care
0	of
PERSON-B	the
PERSON-I	Surgeon
0	,
0	soon
0	recovered
0	.

0	After
0	this
0	detail
0	it
0	was
0	debated
0	,
0	whether
0	to
0	resign
0	Trecher
0	to
0	his
0	fate
0	,
0	or
0	to
0	continue
0	the
0	search
0	.

0	The
0	humanity
0	of
0	the
0	officer
0	,
0	who
0	had
0	the
0	command
0	of
0	the
0	party
0	,
0	prevailed
0	.

0	It
0	was
0	now
0	about
0	ten
0	in
0	the
0	morning
0	,
0	of
0	the
0	29th
0	,
0	when
0	the
0	whole
0	party
0	,
0	after
0	taking
0	some
0	refreshment
0	,
0	set
0	out
0	to
0	scour
0	the
0	thickets
0	,
0	and
0	,
0	by
0	hallooing
0	,
0	ringing
0	of
0	bells
0	,
0	beating
0	of
0	drums
0	,
0	and
0	pursuing
0	different
0	courses
0	,
0	determined
0	he
0	should
0	hear
0	them
0	if
0	he
0	were
0	alive
0	.

0	It
0	was
0	no
0	easy
0	task
0	to
0	penetrate
0	a
0	trackless
0	cover
0	,
0	over-grown
0	with
0	underwood
0	,
0	and
0	abounding
0	with
0	infects
0	,
0	of
0	which
0	the
0	musquitoes
0	were
0	the
0	least
0	troublesome
0	.

0	But
0	numbers
0	make
0	that
0	easy
0	,
0	which
0	to
0	individuals
0	would
0	be
0	impracticable
0	.

0	They
0	went
0	on
0	chearfully
0	at
0	first
0	;

0	but
0	,
0	before
0	a
0	few
0	hours
0	were
0	elapsed
0	,
0	even
0	the
0	gentlemen
0	,
0	who
0	were
0	inspirited
0	by
0	their
0	success
0	in
0	killing
0	game
0	,
0	began
0	to
0	be
0	tired
0	,
0	and
0	it
0	was
0	thought
0	adviseable
0	to
0	rest
0	and
0	refresh
0	during
0	the
0	middle
0	of
0	the
0	day
0	,
0	and
0	to
0	renew
0	the
0	pursuit
0	after
0	they
0	had
0	dined
0	.

0	As
0	yet
0	they
0	had
0	not
0	been
0	able
0	to
0	discover
0	any
0	trace
0	or
0	track
0	of
0	the
0	man
0	they
0	were
0	seeking
0	,
0	though
0	it
0	had
0	been
0	agreed
0	between
0	Trecher
0	and
0	his
0	companion
0	,
0	to
0	cut
0	boughs
0	from
0	the
0	trees
0	,
0	as
0	they
0	passed
0	along
0	,
0	by
0	way
0	of
0	mark
0	or
0	guide
0	to
0	each
0	other
0	,
0	in
0	case
0	of
0	separation
0	.

0	This
0	was
0	no
0	small
0	discouragement
0	;

0	and
0	few
0	had
0	any
0	relish
0	to
0	renew
0	a
0	labour
0	attended
0	with
0	so
0	much
0	fatigue
0	,
0	and
0	so
0	little
0	prospect
0	of
0	success
0	.

0	The
0	officers
0	were
0	alone
0	inflexibly
0	bent
0	on
0	the
0	pursuit
0	.

0	The
0	men
0	,
0	though
0	they
0	were
0	no
0	less
0	willing
0	,
0	were
0	not
0	all
0	equally
0	able
0	to
0	endure
0	the
0	fatigue
0	;

0	and
0	some
0	of
0	them
0	were
0	even
0	ready
0	to
0	drop
0	,
0	before
0	their
0	dinner
0	and
0	their
0	grog
0	had
0	revived
0	their
0	spirits
0	.

0	The
0	only
0	expedient
0	that
0	now
0	remained
0	to
0	be
0	tried
0	,
0	was
0	,
0	that
0	which
0	Trecher
0	himself
0	had
0	projected
0	,
0	namely
0	,
0	to
0	climb
0	the
0	highest
0	tree
0	that
0	appeared
0	in
0	view
0	,
0	in
0	order
0	to
0	look
0	for
0	the
0	hill
0	which
0	he
0	pretended
0	to
0	have
0	seen
0	,
0	and
0	to
0	which
0	it
0	was
0	thought
0	probable
0	that
0	he
0	might
0	direct
0	his
0	course
0	.

0	This
0	was
0	no
0	sooner
0	proposed
0	than
0	executed
0	.

0	In
0	a
0	moment
0	a
0	sailor
0	was
0	perched
0	at
0	the
0	top
0	of
0	every
0	lofty
0	tree
0	in
0	sight
0	,
0	and
0	the
0	high
0	land
0	descried
0	,
0	seemingly
0	at
0	no
0	great
0	distance
0	from
0	the
0	place
0	where
0	the
0	party
0	had
0	dined
0	.

0	It
0	was
0	now
0	agreed
0	,
0	to
0	make
0	the
0	best
0	of
0	their
0	way
0	to
0	the
0	eminence
0	,
0	but
0	this
0	proved
0	not
0	so
0	easy
0	a
0	task
0	as
0	it
0	at
0	first
0	appeared
0	to
0	be
0	.

0	When
0	they
0	thought
0	themselves
0	just
0	ready
0	to
0	mount
0	,
0	they
0	met
0	with
0	a
0	lagoon
0	that
0	interrupted
0	their
0	progress
0	;

0	and
0	coasting
0	it
0	along
0	,
0	they
0	discovered
0	the
0	skeleton
0	of
0	a
0	creature
0	that
0	,
0	by
0	its
0	length
0	,
0	appeared
0	to
0	be
0	an
0	allegator
0	.

0	In
0	viewing
0	this
0	narrowly
0	,
0	something
0	like
0	the
0	track
0	of
0	some
0	large
0	animal
0	was
0	observed
0	to
0	have
0	passed
0	it
0	,
0	and
0	the
0	high
0	grass
0	on
0	the
0	margin
0	of
0	the
0	lagoon
0	to
0	have
0	been
0	fresh
0	trodden
0	.

0	This
0	excited
0	the
0	curiosity
0	of
0	the
0	whole
0	party
0	,
0	who
0	imagined
0	that
0	some
0	monster
0	inhabited
0	the
0	lagoon
0	,
0	against
0	which
0	it
0	was
0	prudent
0	for
0	them
0	to
0	be
0	upon
0	their
0	guard
0	.

0	The
0	waters
0	of
0	the
0	lagoon
0	were
0	salt
0	as
0	brine
0	,
0	and
0	every
0	where
0	skirted
0	with
0	a
0	kind
0	of
0	reed
0	and
0	sedge
0	,
0	that
0	reached
0	as
0	high
0	as
0	a
0	man
0	's
0	head
0	,
0	and
0	could
0	not
0	be
0	penetrated
0	without
0	danger
0	from
0	scorpions
0	or
0	other
0	venomous
0	reptiles
0	,
0	several
0	of
0	which
0	had
0	been
0	seen
0	in
0	the
0	bushes
0	.

0	All
0	attempts
0	therefore
0	of
0	succeeding
0	by
0	this
0	course
0	appeared
0	to
0	be
0	labour
0	lost
0	;

0	and
0	as
0	no
0	other
0	were
0	thought
0	more
0	probable
0	,
0	it
0	was
0	resolved
0	to
0	relinquish
0	the
0	pursuit
0	,
0	and
0	to
0	return
0	to
0	the
0	boats
0	:
0	but
0	the
0	day
0	being
0	already
0	too
0	far
0	spent
0	to
0	make
0	their
0	return
0	practicable
0	before
0	the
0	morning
0	,
0	it
0	was
0	agreed
0	to
0	coast
0	it
0	along
0	the
0	lake
0	,
0	to
0	endeavour
0	to
0	find
0	access
0	to
0	the
0	opposite
0	hills
0	;

0	and
0	this
0	was
0	the
0	more
0	easily
0	effected
0	,
0	as
0	between
0	the
0	sedgey
0	border
0	and
0	the
0	thicket
0	there
0	was
0	an
0	open
0	space
0	of
0	unequal
0	breadth
0	,
0	only
0	sometimes
0	intersected
0	with
0	brambley
0	patches
0	that
0	joined
0	the
0	lake
0	,
0	but
0	of
0	no
0	great
0	extent
0	.

0	Through
0	these
0	they
0	made
0	their
0	way
0	with
0	little
0	opposition
0	till
0	the
0	lake
0	appeared
0	to
0	deepen
0	,
0	when
0	a
0	most
0	stubborn
0	woody
0	copse
0	seemed
0	to
0	bid
0	defiance
0	to
0	their
0	further
0	progress
0	.

0	This
0	difficulty
0	,
0	however
0	,
0	was
0	with
0	much
0	labour
0	surmounted
0	,
0	and
0	it
0	was
0	no
0	sooner
0	passed
0	,
0	than
0	the
0	lake
0	was
0	found
0	to
0	terminate
0	,
0	and
0	the
0	ground
0	to
0	rise
0	.

0	The
0	country
0	began
0	now
0	to
0	put
0	on
0	a
0	new
0	face
0	.

0	The
0	prospect
0	which
0	had
0	hitherto
0	presented
0	nothing
0	but
0	a
0	wild
0	and
0	almost
0	impenetrable
0	thicket
0	,
0	as
0	they
0	ascended
0	the
0	rising
0	ground
0	,
0	became

0	attained
0	the

0	the

0	,
0	was
0	exceedingly
0	picturesque
0	.

0	Here
0	they
0	determined
0	to
0	pass
0	the
0	night
0	within

0	grove

0	which
0	seemed

0	be
0	designed
0	by

0	for
0	a
0	place
0	of
0	rest
0	.

0	The
0	whole

0	now
0	assembled
0	,
0	and
0	orders
0	were
0	given
0	by
0	the
0	commanding
0	officers
0	to
0	erect
0	temporary
0	huts
0	to
0	shelter
0	them
0	from
0	the

0	These

0	In
0	this

0	some
0	were
0	employed
0	in
0	cutting

0	preparing

0	some

0	to

0	kept
0	burning
0	during
0	the

0	,
0	by

0	,
0	to

0	Before

0	,
0	the

0	the

0	at

0	,
0	the

0	set
0	,
0	and
0	the

0	about

0	of
0	night
0	,
0	the

0	was
0	surprized
0	by
0	a
0	four-footed
0	monster
0	.

0	This
0	monster
0	,
0	upon
0	examination
0	,
0	proved
0	no
0	other
0	,
0	than
0	the
0	identical
PERSON-B	Thomas
PERSON-I	Trecher
0	,
0	of
0	whom
0	they
0	had
0	been
0	in
0	search
0	so
0	long
0	,
0	crawling
0	upon
0	all
0	sours
0	;

0	for

0	were
0	so
0	blistered
0	,
0	that
0	he
0	could
0	not
0	stand
0	,
0	and
0	his
0	throat
0	so
0	parched
0	that
0	he
0	could
0	not
0	speak
0	.

0	It
0	is
0	hard
0	to
0	say
0	which
0	was
0	predominant
0	,
0	their
0	joy
0	,
0	their
0	surprize
0	,
0	or
0	their
0	laughter
0	.

0	No
0	time
0	,
0	however
0	,
0	was
0	lost
0	in
0	administering
0	comfort
0	to
0	the
0	poor
0	man
0	.

0	He
0	was
0	a
0	most
0	affecting
0	spectacle
0	,
0	blistered
0	from
0	head
0	to
0	foot
0	by
0	poisonous
0	insects
0	,
0	whose
0	venomous
0	stings
0	had
0	caused
0	such
0	an
0	intolerable
0	itching
0	,
0	that
0	his
0	very
0	blood
0	was
0	inflamed
0	by
0	constant
0	rubbing
0	.

0	By
0	anointing
0	him
0	with
0	oil
0	,
0	the

0	,
0	in
0	some

0	,
0	abated
0	;

0	and
0	by
0	frequently
0	giving
0	him
0	small
0	quantities
0	of
0	tea
0	,
0	mixed
0	with
0	a
0	little
0	brandy
0	,
0	they
0	brought
0	him
0	to
0	his
0	speech
0	;

0	but
0	it
0	was
0	some
0	days
0	before
0	he
0	recovered
0	the
0	perfect
0	use
0	of
0	his
0	faculties
0	.

0	The
0	absence
0	the
0	whole
0	night
0	of
0	the
0	party
0	sent
0	out
0	in
0	search
0	of
0	him
0	,
0	having
0	been
0	reported
0	to
PERSON-B	Capt.
PERSON-I	Cook
0	,
0	he
0	had
0	ordered
0	two
0	boats
0	into
0	the
0	lagoon
0	,
0	to
0	go
0	different
0	ways
0	,
0	to
0	assist
0	in
0	the
0	search
0	;

0	but
0	being
0	in
0	the
0	evening
0	relieved
0	from
0	his
0	anxiety
0	,
0	he
0	recalled
0	the
0	boats
0	,
0	and
0	gave
0	orders
0	to
0	prepare
0	for
0	sailing
0	.

0	We
0	had
0	now
0	been
0	off
0	this
0	island
0	near
0	7
0	days
0	,
0	in
0	which
0	time
0	we
0	had
0	taken
0	more
0	than
0	300
0	turtle
0	,
0	from
0	90
0	to
0	100
0	lb.
0	weight
0	on
0	board
0	.

0	But
0	tho
0	'
0	it
0	seemed
0	more
0	than
0	60
0	leagues
0	in
0	circumference
0	,
0	there
0	were
0	not
0	the
0	smallest
0	traces
0	of
0	any
0	human
0	being
0	having
0	ever
0	been
0	upon
0	it
0	before
0	:
0	and
0	,
0	indeed
0	,
0	should
0	any
0	people
0	be
0	so
0	unfortunate
0	as
0	to
0	be
0	accidentally
0	driven
0	upon
0	it
0	,
0	they
0	could
0	not
0	possibly
0	exist
0	for
0	any
0	length
0	of
0	time
0	.

0	There
0	are
0	,
0	it
0	is
0	true
0	,
0	many
0	birds
0	,
0	and
0	abundance
0	of
0	fish
0	,
0	but
0	no

0	any

0	that

0	.

0	On
0	the
0	few
0	cocoa-trees
0	upon
0	the
0	island
0	,
0	the
0	number
0	of
0	which
0	did
0	not
0	exceed
0	thirty
0	,
0	very
0	little

0	was
0	found
0	;

0	and
0	in

0	,
0	what
0	was
0	found
0	,
0	was

0	grown
0	,
0	or
0	had
0	the
0	juice
0	salt
0	or
0	brackish
0	;

0	so
0	that
0	a
0	ship
0	touching
0	here
0	,
0	must
0	expect
0	nothing
0	but
0	fish
0	and
0	turtle
0	;

0	but
0	not
0	a
0	drop
0	of

0	On

0	,
0	1778
0	,
0	about
0	ten
0	in
0	the

0	,
0	we

0	To

0	which

0	just
0	left
0	,
PERSON-B	Capt.
PERSON-I	Cook
0	gave

0	a

0	The
0	few

0	Early

0	as

0	,
0	and
0	proceeding
0	with
0	a
0	prosperous

0	,
0	and
0	had
0	plenty

0	on

0	the

0	allowed
0	turtle
0	to

0	;

0	which
0	,
0	however
0	,
0	in
0	a
0	few
0	days
0	was

PERSON-B	the

0	of
0	every

0	.

0	This
0	was
0	found
0	both
0	healthful
0	and
0	nourishing
0	,
0	and
0	was
0	continued
0	till
0	within
0	a
0	few
0	days
0	of
0	our
0	arrival
0	at
0	another

0	and
0	water
0	equal

0	we
0	brought

PLACE-I	Isles

0	On
0	the

0	,
0	the

0	shifted
0	W.
0	S.
0	W.
0	and
0	a
0	storm
0	came
0	on
0	,
0	preceded
0	by
0	a
0	louring
0	darkness
0	,
0	that
0	presaged
0	some
0	violent
0	convulsion
0	;

0	and
0	soon
0	after
0	it
0	broke
0	forth
0	in
0	thunder
0	,
0	lightning
0	,
0	wind
0	,
0	and
0	rain
0	,
0	which
0	in
0	two
0	hours
0	increased
0	to
0	such
0	a
0	violent
0	degree
0	,
0	as
0	no

0	on

0	Fortunately
0	for
0	us
0	,
0	its
0	violence
0	in
0	a
0	few
0	hours
0	abated
0	;

0	but
0	in
0	that
0	little
0	time
0	the
0	sea
0	broke
0	over
0	our

0	,

0	cleared
0	the

0	that

0	.

0	Before
0	noon
0	,
0	the

0	subsided
0	,
0	but
0	the
0	rain
0	continued
0	till
0	evening
0	,
0	of
0	which
0	we
0	made
0	good

0	.

0	From

0	time
0	of
0	our
0	leaving
PLACE-B	Ulietea
0	to

0	day
0	,
0	we
0	had
0	received

0	and
0	,
0	though

0	been
0	constantly
0	at
0	work
0	,
0	our

0	scanty
0	.

0	This
0	afternoon
0	,
0	several
0	indications
0	of

0	were
0	observed
0	;

0	such

0	The

0	made

0	and
0	stand
0	to

0	,
0	after

0	to

0	,
0	which

0	13.3.

0	,
0	the

0	after

0	all

0	without

0	we
0	again
0	stood

0	From

0	nothing

0	all
0	that
0	he
0	suffered
0	in
0	his
0	person
0	.

0	He
0	confirmed
0	Loreman
0	's
0	relation
0	of
0	what
0	passed
0	while
0	they
0	remained
0	together
0	;

0	but
0	,
0	in
0	the
0	morning
0	of
0	the
0	29th
0	,
0	when
0	they
0	agreed
0	to
0	part
0	,
0	his
0	thoughts
0	ran
0	chiefly
0	on
0	discovering
0	some
0	house
0	or
0	place
0	of
0	resort
0	of
0	the
0	natives
0	,
0	as
0	it
0	ran
0	strongly
0	in
0	his
0	mind
0	,
0	that
0	an
0	island
0	of
0	such
0	extent
0	as
0	that
0	appeared
0	to
0	be
0	,
0	could
0	not
0	be
0	wholly
0	destitute
0	of
0	inhabitants
0	.

0	In
0	pursuit
0	of
0	this
0	idea
0	,
0	he
0	determined
0	to
0	make
0	towards
0	the
0	hill
0	or
0	high
0	land
0	,
0	which
0	he
0	had
0	seen
0	from
0	the
0	top
0	of
0	the
0	tree
0	;

0	and
0	to
0	observe
0	the
0	course
0	of
0	the
0	sun
0	for
0	his
0	guide
0	,
0	but
0	he
0	met
0	with
0	many
0	obstructions
0	that
0	retarded
0	his
0	progress
0	.

0	The
0	reeds
0	and
0	the
0	rough
0	grass
0	were
0	in
0	many
0	places
0	so
0	high
0	and
0	thick
0	,
0	that
0	he
0	was
0	almost
0	suffocated
0	in
0	attempting
0	to
0	get
0	through
0	them
0	,
0	and
0	was
0	frequently
0	obliged
0	to
0	return
0	,
0	when
0	he
0	thought
0	he
0	had
0	nearly
0	reached
0	the
0	opposite
0	side
0	.

0	Though
0	there
0	were
0	serpents
0	,
0	and
0	,
0	he
0	believed
0	,
0	scorpions
0	,
0	continually
0	bissing
0	,
0	in
0	almost
0	all
0	directions
0	,
0	the
0	fear
0	of
0	being
0	stung
0	by
0	them
0	was
0	absorbed
0	by
0	the
0	more
0	immediate
0	torture
0	he
0	felt
0	from
0	the
0	musquitoes
0	,
0	and
0	other
0	venomous
0	insects
0	,
0	that
0	fastened
0	upon
0	him
0	,
0	and
0	teized
0	him
0	incessantly
0	;

0	add
0	to
0	these
0	distresses
0	,
0	the
0	bad
0	condition
0	of
0	his
0	shoes
0	,
0	which
0	were
0	worn
0	to
0	shreds
0	;

0	and
0	,
0	though
0	he
0	tied
0	them
0	round
0	and
0	round
0	with
0	cords
0	made
0	of
0	twisted
0	grass
0	,
0	yet
0	it
0	was
0	hardly
0	possible
0	for
0	him
0	to
0	keep
0	them
0	upon
0	his
0	feet
0	for
0	ten
0	steps
0	together
0	.

0	In
0	this
0	melancholy
0	situation
0	,
0	rest
0	was
0	a
0	stranger
0	to
0	him
0	;

0	yet
0	sleep
0	would
0	sometimes
0	close
0	his
0	eyes
0	,
0	and
0	fill
0	his
0	imagination
0	with
0	horrors
0	still
0	more
0	distressing
0	than
0	those
0	he
0	felt
0	while
0	awake
0	.

0	Towards
0	the
0	evening
0	of
0	the
0	29th
0	,
0	he
0	thought
0	he
0	heard
0	the
0	howling
0	of
0	dogs
0	;

0	and
0	,
0	a-while
0	after
0	,
0	the
0	growling
0	of
0	some
0	savage
0	beast
0	,
0	but
0	of
0	what
0	species
0	he
0	could
0	not
0	tell
0	;

0	however
0	,
0	he
0	saw
0	nothing
0	,
0	and
0	these
0	might
0	only
0	be
0	the
0	creatures
0	of
0	his
0	own
0	disturbed
0	fancy
0	.

0	Towards
0	night
0	he
0	got
0	together
0	a
0	quantity
0	of
0	broad
0	leaves
0	from
0	the
0	trees
0	to
0	make
0	him
0	a
0	bed
0	,
0	and
0	to
0	cover
0	his
0	face
0	and
0	hands
0	from
0	the
0	black
0	ants
0	.

0	To
0	allay
0	his
0	thirst
0	,
0	he
0	thought
0	of
0	chewing
0	the
0	stems
0	of
0	a
0	reed
0	,
0	that
0	had
0	a
0	saccharine
0	taste
0	,
0	and
0	was
0	probably
0	a
0	wild
0	kind
0	of
0	sugar-cane
0	,
0	which
0	gave
0	him
0	some
0	refreshment
0	,
0	and
0	contributed
0	not
0	a
0	little
0	to
0	his
0	preservation
0	.

0	Soon
0	as
0	day
0	began
0	to
0	dawn
0	,
0	he
0	found
0	himself
0	weak
0	and
0	languid
0	,
0	and
0	had
0	very
0	little
0	stomach
0	to
0	renew
0	his
0	labour
0	.

0	His
0	first
0	care
0	,
0	however
0	,
0	was
0	to
0	repair
0	his
0	shoes
0	.

0	This
0	he
0	did
0	by
0	forming
0	wisps
0	of
0	grass
0	into
0	the
0	shape
0	of
0	soals
0	,
0	and
0	placing
0	them
0	underneath
0	the
0	remains
0	of
0	the
0	leather
0	pb
0	n
0	=
0	"
0	194
0	"
0	/
0	&gt;
0	soals
0	.

0	He
0	then
0	tied
0	them
0	together
0	round
0	his
0	feet
0	and
0	ankles
0	with
0	cords
0	,
0	made
0	as
0	before
0	;

0	and
0	with
0	these
0	he
0	made
0	shift
0	to
0	scramble
0	on
0	a-while
0	,
0	but
0	they
0	soon
0	wanted
0	repair
0	.

0	He
0	again
0	had
0	recourse
0	to
0	his
0	first
0	expedient
0	,
0	and
0	mounted
0	a
0	tree
0	that
0	over-topped
0	the
0	cover
0	,
0	and
0	got
0	sight
0	of
0	the
0	high
0	land
0	that
0	first
0	animated
0	his
0	pursuit
0	.

0	He
0	thought
0	it
0	so
0	near
0	that
0	he
0	could
0	soon
0	reach
0	it
0	;

0	and
0	,
0	hastening
0	down
0	,
0	made
0	his
0	way
0	with
0	more
0	alacrity
0	than
0	ever
0	,
0	being
0	prepossessed
0	that
0	if
0	he
0	reached
0	that
0	eminence
0	,
0	his
0	deliverance
0	would
0	be
0	certain
0	.

0	For
0	some
0	hours
0	he
0	struggled
0	through
0	the
0	most
0	formidable
0	obstacles
0	,
0	the
0	cover
0	being
0	now
0	so
0	thick
0	and
0	strong
0	,
0	and
0	withal
0	so
0	high
0	,
0	that
0	he
0	could
0	hardly
0	see
0	the
0	light
0	over
0	his
0	head
0	through
0	the
0	leaves
0	and
0	the
0	bushes
0	.

0	This
0	happened
0	to
0	be
0	the
0	outer
0	border
0	that
0	skirted
0	the
0	lagoon
0	,
0	which
0	when
0	he
0	had
0	penetrated
0	,
0	and
0	found
0	an
0	opening
0	,
0	his
0	heart
0	leaped
0	within
0	him
0	;

0	but
0	his
0	joy
0	was
0	or
0	short
0	duration
0	.

0	He
0	presently
0	discovered
0	that
0	he
0	had
0	another
0	difficulty
0	to
0	furmount
0	,
0	before
0	he
0	could
0	reach
0	the
0	summit
0	of
0	his
0	wishes
0	.

0	He
0	attempted
0	the
0	lagoon
0	,
0	and
0	waded
0	nearly
0	across
0	,
0	without
0	the
0	water
0	rising
0	higher
0	than
0	his
0	middle
0	,
0	but
0	all
0	at
0	once
0	plunged
0	over-head
0	in
0	deep
0	water
0	,
0	and
0	it
0	was
0	next
0	to
0	a
0	miracle
0	that
0	he
0	saved
0	himself
0	from
0	drowning
0	.

0	He
0	then
0	returned
0	quite
0	exhausted
0	and
0	dejected
0	,
0	and
0	breaking
0	through
0	the
0	sedge
0	of
0	the
0	margin
0	of
0	the
0	lake
0	,
0	he
0	stumbled
0	upon
0	the
0	skeleton
0	of
0	the
0	monster
0	already
0	mentioned
0	,
0	which
0	he
0	believed
0	was
0	fifty
0	feet
0	long
0	.

0	He
0	was
0	so
0	scared
0	at
0	the
0	fight
0	of
0	the
0	bones
0	,
0	that
0	his
0	hair
0	stood
0	on-end
0	,
0	and
0	he
0	thought
0	of
0	nothing
0	now
0	but
0	being
0	eaten
0	up
0	alive
0	.

0	Totally
0	dispirited
0	,
0	and
0	faint
0	for
0	want
0	of
0	food
0	or
0	any
0	thing
0	to
0	drink
0	,
0	and
0	deprived
0	of
0	all
0	means
0	of
0	proceeding
0	any
0	farther
0	,
0	he
0	crept
0	along
0	the
0	lake
0	till
0	he
0	came
0	to
0	a
0	cocoa-nut
0	tree
0	near
0	the
0	edge
0	of
0	the
0	thicket
0	,
0	which
0	he
0	attempted
0	to
0	climb
0	,
0	but
0	fell
0	down
0	for
0	want
0	of
0	strength
0	to
0	keep
0	his
0	hold
0	,
0	and
0	lay
0	for
0	several
0	hours
0	incapable
0	of
0	motion
0	.

0	He
0	heard
0	,
0	he
0	said
0	,
0	a
0	noise
0	in
0	the
0	cover
0	,
0	in
0	the
0	day
0	,
0	but
0	could
0	neither
0	halloo
0	to
0	be
0	heard
0	,
0	nor
0	follow
0	the
PLACE-B	sound
0	,
0	though
0	some
0	of
0	the
0	company
0	must
0	have
0	passed
0	very
0	near
0	him
0	;

0	but
0	seeing
0	the
0	fire
0	lighted
0	on
0	the
0	hill
0	in
0	the
0	evening
0	,
0	it
0	encouraged
0	him
0	to
0	make
0	one
0	struggle
0	more
0	for
0	life
0	.

0	Without
0	a
0	shoe
0	to
0	his
0	foot
0	,
0	having
0	lost
0	them
0	in
0	the
0	lake
0	,
0	he
0	made
0	shift
0	to
0	crawl
0	up
0	the
0	hill
0	,
0	as
0	already
0	related
0	.

0	Few
0	readers
0	will
0	think
0	it
0	possible
0	for
0	a
0	man
0	to
0	suffer
0	so
0	much
0	in
0	so
0	short
0	a
0	time
0	;

0	and
0	yet
0	many
0	have
0	lost
0	their
0	lives
0	by
0	being
0	bewildered
0	in
PLACE-B	England
0	,
0	and
0	many
0	more
0	on
0	the
0	wild
0	heaths
0	in
PLACE-B	Scotland
0	,
0	which
0	cannot
0	be
0	supposed
0	to
0	be
0	so
0	dangerous
0	as
0	the
0	thick
0	cover
0	of
0	a
0	desolate
0	island
0	,
0	where
0	no
0	man
0	ever
0	set
0	his
0	foot
0	before
0	.

0	But
0	,
0	be
0	that
0	as
0	it
0	may
0	,
0	such
0	is
0	the
0	account
0	given
0	by
0	Trecher
0	,
0	of
0	his

0	at

0	,
0	without

0	On
0	the

0	a
0	very
0	severe
0	storm
0	arose
0	,
0	which
0	blew
0	with
0	irrestible
0	fury
0	for
0	some
0	hours
0	,
0	and
0	obliged

0	in
0	a

0	came

0	of

0	,
0	apparently
0	of
0	an

0	.

0	As
0	we
0	approached
0	the

0	,
0	it
0	presented
0	no
0	very

0	,

0	surrounded

0	,
0	without

0	stood
0	off

0	on
0	till

0	20th
0	,
0	when
0	we
0	bore
0	away
0	for

0	,
0	but
0	not
0	then
0	in

0	About

0	to
0	exhibit
0	a
0	prospect
0	so
0	full
0	of
0	plenty
0	,
0	that
0	we
0	anticipated
0	the
0	pleasure
0	we
0	expected
0	,
0	by
0	supposing
0	ourselves
0	already
0	in
0	possession
0	of
0	a
0	most
0	seasonable
0	supply
0	.

0	We
0	had
0	been
0	for
0	several
0	days
0	reduced
0	to
0	the
0	scanty
0	allowance
0	of
0	a
0	quart
0	of
0	water
0	a-day
0	,
0	and
0	that
0	none
0	of
0	the
0	best
0	;

0	and
0	now
0	that
0	we
0	saw
0	,
0	or
0	thought
0	we
0	saw
0	,
0	whole
0	rivers
0	before
0	us
0	,
0	our
0	hearts
0	were
0	dilated
0	with
0	joy
0	;

0	yet
0	we
0	had
0	still
0	much
0	to
0	suffer
0	.

0	We
0	found
0	ourselves
0	debarred
0	from
0	the
0	thing
0	we
0	were
0	most
0	in
0	want
0	of
0	for
0	several
0	days
0	,
0	by
0	shoals
0	and
0	rocks
0	that
0	to
0	us
0	were
0	impracticable
0	.

0	We
0	coasted
0	along
0	the
0	N.
0	W.
0	side
0	of
0	the
0	island
0	,
0	sounding
0	as
0	we
0	went
0	,
0	while
0	the
0	boats
0	from
0	both
0	ships
0	were
0	employed
0	in
0	searching
0	for
0	some
0	bay
0	or
0	harbour
0	,
0	where
0	we
0	might
0	safely
0	anchor
0	.

0	In
0	the
0	mean
0	time
0	,
0	several
0	canoes
0	came
0	from
0	the
0	shore
0	with
0	plantains
0	and
0	dried
0	fish
0	on
0	board
0	,
0	who
0	parted
0	with
0	what
0	they
0	had
0	for
0	any
0	trifles
0	that
0	were
0	offered
0	them
0	;

0	and
0	at
0	first
0	behaved
0	with
0	great
0	civility
0	,
0	but
0	could
0	not
0	be
0	persuaded
0	to
0	venture
0	on
0	board
0	.

0	At
0	five
0	in
0	the
0	evening
0	,
0	we
0	were
0	two
0	leagues
0	from
0	the
0	shore
0	,
0	surrounded
0	by
0	Indians
0	in
0	their
0	canoes
0	,
0	with
0	hogs
0	in
0	abundance
0	,
0	some
0	very
0	large
0	,
0	which
0	we
0	purchased
0	according
0	to
0	their
0	size
0	,
0	for
0	a
0	spike
0	or
0	a
0	ten-penny
0	nail
0	each
0	.

0	While
0	we
0	remained
0	at
0	sea
0	,
0	no
0	people
0	on
0	earth
0	could
0	be
0	more
0	friendly
0	;

0	but
0	our
0	boats
0	had
0	no
0	sooner
0	landed
0	,
0	than
0	a
0	quarrel
0	arose
0	between
0	the
0	natives
0	and
0	our
0	people
0	,
0	which
0	was
0	terminated
0	by
0	the
0	death
0	of
0	one
0	of
0	the
0	former
0	.

0	It
0	was
0	said
0	that
0	the
0	Indians
0	were
0	the
0	aggressors
0	,
0	by
0	throwing
0	stones
0	at
0	the
0	boats
0	to
0	prevent
0	the
0	people
0	from
0	landing
0	,
0	and
0	that
0	orders
0	being
0	given
0	to
0	fire
0	a
0	gun
0	over
0	the
0	heads
0	of
0	the
0	assailants
0	,
0	without
0	doing
0	them
0	any
0	hur
0	;

0	tinstead
0	of
0	commanding
0	respect
0	,
0	it
0	only
0	encouraged
0	them
0	in
0	insolence
0	,
0	till
PERSON-B	Mr.
PERSON-I	W
0	—
0	,
0	our
0	third
0	Lieutenant
0	,
0	presenting
0	his
0	piece
0	,
0	shot
0	one
0	of
0	the
0	ringleaders
0	dead
0	upon
0	the
0	spot
0	.

0	This
0	early
0	act
0	of
0	severity
0	was
0	probably
0	the
0	means
0	of
0	saving
0	many
0	lives
0	.

0	The
0	Indians
0	dispersed
0	immediately
0	,
0	carrying
0	off
0	the
0	dead
0	body
0	with
0	them
0	.

0	And
0	the
0	boats
0	,
0	not
0	having
0	made
0	any
0	discovery
0	,
0	returned
0	to
0	the
0	ships
0	,
0	where
0	they
0	were
0	taken
0	on
0	board
0	,
0	and
0	secured
0	till
0	next
0	morning
0	.

0	On
0	the
0	21st
0	the
0	boats
0	were
0	again
0	sent
0	out
0	,
0	but
0	to
0	as
0	little
0	purpose
0	as
0	before
0	.

0	Little
0	trade
0	was
0	this
0	day
0	carried
0	on
0	,
0	as
0	the
0	natives
0	seemed
0	very
0	shy
0	.

0	But
0	,
0	On
0	the
0	22d
0	,
0	the
0	ships
0	having
0	found
0	anchorage
0	on
0	the
0	south-west
0	side
0	,
0	they
0	were
0	no
0	sooner
0	moored
0	than
0	they
0	were
0	again
0	surrounded
0	with
0	a
0	more
0	numerous
0	multitude
0	of
0	islanders
0	than
0	before
0	,
0	who
0	seemed
0	to
0	express
0	the
0	greatest
0	astonishment
0	at
0	the
0	greatness
0	of
0	our
0	ships
0	;

0	nor
0	did
0	it
0	appear
0	that
0	they
0	had
0	ever
0	seen
0	an
0	European
0	ship
0	before
0	,
0	though
0	they
0	were
0	not
0	wholly
0	unacquainted
0	with
0	the
0	use
0	of
0	iron
0	.

0	Most
0	of
0	their
0	canoes
0	were
0	laden
0	with
0	hogs
0	,
0	plantains
0	,
0	bananoes
0	and
0	sweet
0	potatoes
0	,
0	which
0	they
0	readily
0	exchanged
0	chiefly
0	for
0	iron
0	.

0	Here
0	the
0	sailors
0	were
0	suffered
0	to
0	make
0	what
0	purchases
0	they
0	pleased
0	;

0	only
0	women
0	were
0	prohibited
0	by
PERSON-B	Capt.
PERSON-I	Cook
0	's
0	order
0	,
0	on
0	the
0	severest
0	penalties
0	.

0	—
0	This
0	caution
0	,
0	which
0	was
0	undoubtedly
0	dictated
0	by
0	humanity
0	,
0	to
0	prevent
0	the
0	introduction
0	of
0	a
0	loathsome
0	disease
0	among
0	an
0	innocent
0	people
0	,
0	created
0	a
0	general
0	murmur
0	among
0	the
0	seamen
0	,
0	whose
0	pleasure
0	was
0	centered
0	in
0	that
0	kind
0	of
0	commerce
0	,
0	in
0	the
0	new
0	discovered
0	islands
0	,
0	wherever
0	they
0	went
0	.

0	In
0	the
0	afternoon
0	the
0	pinnace
0	was
0	ordered
0	out
0	,
0	and
0	the
0	two
0	Captains
0	landed
0	on
0	the
0	beach
0	,
0	where
0	they
0	were
0	met
0	by
0	the
0	Chiefs
0	of
0	the
0	island
0	,
0	and
0	more
0	than
0	2000
0	of
0	their
0	subjects
0	,
0	not
0	in
0	a
0	hostile
0	manner
0	,
0	but
0	in
0	amity
0	,
0	exchanging
0	presents
0	,
0	and
0	establishing
0	trade
0	.

PERSON-B	Capt.
PERSON-I	Cook
0	made
0	signs
0	for
0	water
0	,
0	and
0	was
0	conducted
0	to
0	a
0	most
0	delightful
0	pool
0	,
0	so
0	conveniently
0	situated
0	for
0	supplying
0	the
0	ships
0	,
0	that
0	,
0	had
0	not
0	the
0	Resolution
0	been
0	driven
0	from
0	her
0	moorings
0	by
0	the
0	violence
0	of
0	an
0	easterly
0	wind
0	and
0	strong
0	current
0	,
0	nothing
0	could
0	have
0	exceeded
0	our
0	entertainment
0	at
0	this
0	hospitable
0	port
0	.

0	We
0	met
0	with
0	no
0	obstruction
0	in
0	watering
0	.

0	These
0	people
0	merited
0	our
0	best
0	commendations
0	in
0	their
0	commercial
0	intercourse
0	,
0	never
0	once
0	attempting
0	to
0	cheat
0	us
0	,
0	either
0	ashore
0	,
0	or
0	along-side
0	the
0	ships
0	.

0	Some
0	of
0	them
0	,
0	indeed
0	,
0	at
0	first
0	betrayed
0	a
0	thievish
0	disposition
0	;

0	or
0	rather
0	they
0	thought
0	,
0	that
0	they
0	had
0	a
0	right
0	to
0	every
0	thing
0	they
0	could
0	lay
0	their
0	hands
0	on
0	;

0	but
0	we
0	soon
0	convinced
0	them
0	,
0	that
0	this
0	conduct
0	was
0	not
0	to
0	be
0	suffered
0	with
0	impunity
0	.

0	One
0	of
0	our
0	visitors
0	,
0	in
0	the
0	course
0	of
0	trade
0	,
0	offered
0	some
0	fish-hooks
0	to
0	sell
0	.

0	He
0	was
0	observed
0	to
0	have
0	a
0	small
0	parcel
0	tied
0	to
0	the
0	string
0	of
0	one
0	of
0	them
0	,
0	which
0	he
0	separated
0	with
0	great
0	care
0	,
0	and
0	reserved
0	for
0	himself
0	.

0	Being
0	asked
0	what
0	it
0	was
0	,
0	he
0	pointed
0	to
0	his
0	belly
0	,
0	and
0	spoke
0	something
0	,
0	which
0	we
0	could
0	not
0	understand
0	;

0	at
0	the
0	same
0	time
0	saying
0	it
0	was
0	bad
0	,
0	as
0	if
0	he
0	did
0	not
0	wish
0	to
0	answer
0	any
0	more
0	questions
0	about
0	it
0	.

0	On
0	seeing
0	him
0	so
0	anxious
0	to
0	conceal
0	the
0	contents
0	,
0	he
0	was
0	requested
0	to
0	open
0	it
0	,
0	which
0	he
0	did
0	with
0	great
0	reluctance
0	.

0	They
0	found
0	that
0	it
0	contained
0	a
0	thin
0	Page
0	&#91;
0	unnumbered
0	&#93;
0	&#91;
0	illustration
0	&#93;
0	&#91;
0	depiction
0	of

0	of
0	the
PLACE-B	Sandwich

0	p

0	199.
0	bit
0	of
0	flesh
0	,
0	which
0	to
0	appearance
0	had
0	been
0	dried
0	,
0	but
0	was
0	now
0	wet
0	with
0	salt
0	water
0	.

0	It
0	struck
0	us
0	that
0	it
0	might
0	be
0	human
0	flesh
0	,
0	and
0	the
0	question
0	being
0	put
0	to
0	him
0	,
0	he
0	answered
0	,
0	that
0	the
0	flesh
0	was
0	part
0	of
0	a
0	man
0	.

0	Another
0	of
0	his
0	countrymen
0	,
0	who
0	stood
0	by
0	,
0	was
0	then
0	asked
0	,
0	whether
0	it
0	was
0	their
0	custom
0	to
0	eat
0	those
0	killed
0	in
0	battle
0	,
0	and
0	he
0	immediately
0	answered
0	in
0	the
0	affirmative
0	.

0	Other
0	proofs
0	were
0	not
0	wanting
0	to
0	confirm
0	this
0	abominable
0	practice
0	;

0	and
0	also
0	that
0	they
0	,
0	like
0	the
0	Otaheiteans
0	,
0	offered
0	up
0	human
0	sacrifices
0	.

0	We
0	found
0	,
0	indeed
0	,
0	upon
0	further
0	acquaintance
0	,
0	such
0	a
0	similarity
0	of
0	language
0	,
0	manners
0	,
0	customs
0	,
0	religious
0	rites
0	,
0	and
0	,
0	in
0	short
0	,
0	propensities
0	of
0	disposition
0	,
0	as
0	left
0	us
0	no
0	room
0	to
0	doubt
0	of
0	their
0	once
0	having
0	been
0	one
0	and
0	the
0	same
0	people
0	.

0	When
0	the
0	Resolution
0	was
0	forced
0	to
0	sea
0	she
0	had
0	but
0	half
0	her
0	complement
0	of
0	water
0	;

0	nor
0	had
0	she
0	fresh
0	provisions
0	sufficient
0	to
0	supply
0	her
0	people
0	for
0	any
0	length
0	of
0	time
0	.

0	We
0	in
0	the
0	Discovery
0	were
0	more
0	fortunate
0	.

0	In
0	the
0	evening
0	of
0	the
0	24th
0	we
0	could
0	see
0	the
0	Resolution
0	to
0	leeward
0	eight
0	or
0	nine
0	leagues
0	;

0	and
0	in
0	the
0	mean
0	time
0	,
0	while
0	she
0	was
0	beating
0	up
0	,
0	we
0	were
0	employed
0	in
0	compleating
0	our
0	hold
0	.

0	On
0	the
0	24th
0	,
0	one
0	of
0	their
0	great
0	men
0	paid
0	a
0	visit
0	to
PERSON-B	Capt.
PERSON-I	Clerke
0	.

0	He
0	came
0	off
0	in
0	a
0	double
0	canoe
0	,
0	and
0	like
0	the
0	King
0	of
0	the
PLACE-B	Friendly
PLACE-I	Islands
0	,
0	paid
0	no
0	regard
0	to
0	the
0	small
0	canoes
0	that
0	lay
0	in
0	her
0	way
0	,
0	but
0	run
0	against
0	them
0	,
0	or
0	over
0	them
0	,
0	without
0	endeavouring
0	in
0	the
0	least
0	to
0	avoid
0	them
0	.

0	His
0	attendants
0	helped
0	him
0	into
0	the
0	ship
0	,
0	and
0	placed
0	him
0	on
0	the
0	gangway
0	,
0	where
0	they
0	stood
0	round
0	him
0	,
0	holding
0	each
0	other
0	by
0	the
0	hands
0	;

0	nor
0	would
0	suffer
0	any
0	one
0	to
0	come
0	near
0	him
0	,
0	but
0	Capt.
0	Clerke
0	himself
0	.

PERSON-B	Capt.
PERSON-I	Clerke
0	made

0	some

0	a

0	after

0	The

0	,
0	that

0	had
0	provided
0	a

0	present
0	on

0	anxious
0	to
0	get
0	to
0	sea
0	and
0	join
0	the
0	Resolution
0	,
0	the

0	did
0	not
0	think
0	it
0	adviseable
0	to
0	accept
0	the
0	invitation
0	.

0	This
0	was
0	the
0	only
0	Chief
0	of

0	On
0	the

0	,
0	and
0	,
0	having
0	lost
0	sight
0	of
0	the

0	,
0	we
0	imagined
0	that
0	,
0	not
0	being
0	able
0	to
0	fetch
0	her
0	former
0	station
0	,
0	she
0	had
0	bore
0	away
0	to
0	another

0	been
0	seen

0	about
0	10
0	or
0	12
0	leagues
0	.

0	On
0	the
0	26th
0	we
0	weighed
0	,
0	directing
0	our
0	course
0	to
0	the
0	N.
0	W.
0	but
0	about
0	ten
0	in
0	the
0	morning
0	,
0	the
0	man
0	at
0	the
0	mast-head
0	descried
0	the

0	at
0	a
0	great
0	distance
0	,
0	bearing
0	S.
0	by
0	W.
0	whereupon
0	we
0	instantly
0	tacked

0	and
0	stood
0	S.
0	by
0	E.
0	to
0	join
0	our
0	Commodore
0	.

0	This
0	being
0	effected
0	,
0	we
0	remained
0	several

0	but
0	in

0	,
0	to
0	regain

0	.

0	On
0	the

0	The

0	,
0	before

0	Our

0	the

0	,
0	on
0	the
0	evening
0	of
0	The
0	1st
0	of
0	February
0	we

0	Early

0	on

0	,
0	nor

0	the

0	less
0	ingenious
0	or
0	civilized
0	.

0	It
0	is
0	not
0	a
0	little
0	astonishing
0	,
0	therefore
0	,
0	that
0	they
0	should
0	remain
0	so
0	long
0	unknown
0	to
0	the

0	,
0	as
0	they
0	lie

0	now

0	be
0	their
0	rendezvous
0	for
0	refreshments
0	.

0	Except
0	the
0	first
0	quarrel
0	that
0	happened
0	,
0	of
0	which
0	we
0	have
0	already
0	spoken
0	,
0	we
0	had
0	not
0	the
0	least
0	difference
0	with
0	any
0	of
0	the
0	natives
0	during
0	our
0	stay
0	.

0	What
0	they
0	had
0	to
0	dispose
0	of
0	they
0	parted
0	with
0	upon
0	the
0	easiest
0	terms
0	;

0	nor
0	did
0	they
0	seem
0	quite
0	so
0	thievishly
0	inclined
0	as
0	those
0	on
0	the
0	other
0	side
0	the
0	line
0	.

0	Every
0	island
0	in
0	this
0	group
0	,
0	of
0	which
0	there
0	are
0	more
0	than
0	we
0	could
0	count
0	,
0	appeared
0	to
0	be
0	well
0	peopled
0	.

0	In
0	that
0	which
0	we
0	first
0	visited
0	,
0	called
0	by
0	the
0	natives
0	Ottooi
0	,
0	it
0	was
0	no
0	uncommon
0	thing
0	to
0	see
0	between
0	two
0	and
0	three
0	thousand
0	of
0	the
0	natives
0	assemble
0	on
0	the
0	beech
0	,
0	when
0	any
0	thing
0	was
0	to
0	be
0	shewn
0	that
0	excited
0	their
0	curiosity
0	.

0	And
0	there
0	we
0	learned
0	the
0	names
0	of
0	four
0	other
0	islands
0	,
0	viz
0	.

0	Woahoo
0	,
PLACE-B	Oneeheow
0	,
0	Oreehowe
0	,
0	and
0	Tahoora
0	;

0	the
0	last
0	inhabited
0	by
0	birds
0	,
0	of
0	which
0	there
0	were
0	,
0	as
0	we
0	were
0	told
0	,
0	incredible
0	numbers
0	.

0	The
0	men
0	in
0	these
0	islands
0	are
0	of
0	the
0	middle
0	size
0	,
0	of
0	a
0	dark
0	complexion
0	,
0	not
0	much
0	tattowed
0	,
0	but
0	of
0	a
0	lively
0	open
0	countenance
0	.

0	They
0	were
0	no
0	otherwise
0	clothed
0	than
0	decency
0	required
0	;

0	and
0	what
0	they
0	had
0	on
0	appeared
0	to
0	be
0	their
0	own
0	manufacture
0	,
0	of
0	which
0	there
0	were
0	various
0	fabricks
0	,
0	and
0	of
0	a
0	variety
0	of
0	colours
0	.

0	Some
0	were
0	made
0	with
0	borders
0	exactly
0	resembling
0	coverlets
0	,
0	and
0	others
0	appeared
0	like
0	printed
0	cottons
0	;

0	and
0	,
0	besides
0	cloth
0	,
0	they
0	had
0	many
0	other
0	articles
0	which
0	shewed
0	that
0	they
0	had
0	artificers
0	among
0	them
0	not
0	wanting
0	in
0	ingenuity
0	.

0	One
0	peculiarity
0	we
0	observed
0	among
0	the
0	men
0	,
0	and
0	that
0	was
0	,
0	in
0	the
0	cut
0	of
0	their
0	hair
0	,
0	which
0	they
0	trimmed
0	up
0	to
0	a
0	ridge
0	along
0	their
0	heads
0	,
0	in
0	form
0	like
0	what
0	,
0	in
0	horses
0	manes
0	,
0	is
0	called
0	hogging
0	.

0	Others
0	again
0	wore
0	it
0	long
0	,
0	plaiting
0	it
0	in
0	tails
0	,
0	which
0	hung
0	below
0	the
0	waist
0	;

0	and
0	these
0	we
0	took
0	for
0	marks
0	of
0	distinction
0	among
0	them
0	.

0	Add
0	to
0	/

0	this
0	,
0	a
0	kind
0	of
0	cap
0	and
0	short
0	cloak
0	worn
0	by
0	their
0	Chiefs
0	,
0	in

0	like
0	those
0	worn
0	by
0	the

0	in
PLACE-B	England
0	,
0	and
0	composed

0	,
0	ranged

0	terminated
0	in
0	a
0	kind
0	of
0	net-work
0	round
0	the

0	.

0	The
0	brilliant
0	colours
0	of
0	the
0	feathers
0	in
0	those
0	that
0	happened
0	to
0	be
0	new
0	,
0	added
0	not
0	a
0	little
0	to
0	their
0	fine
0	appearance
0	;

0	and
0	we
0	found
0	that
0	they
0	were
0	in
0	great
0	estimation
0	with
0	their
0	owners
0	,
0	for
0	they
0	would
0	not
0	at

0	part
0	with
0	one
0	of
0	them
0	for
0	any
0	thing
0	that

0	offered
0	,
0	asking
0	no
0	less
0	for
0	each
0	than
0	a
0	musket
0	.

0	However
0	,
0	some
0	were
0	afterwards
0	purchased
0	for
0	very
0	large
0	nails
0	.

0	The
0	best
0	sort
0	was
0	certainly
0	scarce
0	,
0	and
0	it
0	should
0	seem
0	,
0	were
0	only
0	used
0	at
0	their
0	theatrical
0	exhibitions
0	,
0	or

0	.

0	The

0	,
0	having

0	The

0	they
0	were
0	at

0	They

PERSON-B	Cook
0	's
0	severe

0	put
0	a
0	check
0	to
0	the

0	of
0	our

0	.

0	Their
0	dress
0	,
0	upon

0	To

0	Their

0	Their

0	two

0	That

0	of

0	before
0	we
0	landed

0	the

0	,

0	,
0	how
0	to

0	the
0	use
0	of

0	,

0	certainly
0	did
0	,
0	by

0	This

0	Wood

0	Hogs

0	nor

0	well

0	.

0	The

0	There

0	,
0	a

0	though

0	that
0	,
0	as
0	the

0	they

0	One

0	that

0	,
0	pulling
0	out

0	From
0	observing
0	this

0	,
0	some

0	that
0	the

0	of
0	the

0	was
0	once
0	one

0	that
0	what
0	is
0	now
0	the
0	Great
0	South

0	Ocean
0	,
0	was
0	,
0	in

0	,
0	the
PLACE-B	Paradise
0	of

0	will

0	to

0	Theory
0	of
0	the

0	,
0	where
0	,

0	But

PERSON-B	Capt.
PERSON-I	Cook
0	,
0	the
0	short

0	he
0	remained
0	at
0	Atooi
0	,
0	visited
0	the
0	morais
0	on
0	the

0	,
0	which
0	formerly
0	had
0	been
0	most
0	magnificent
0	structures
0	,
0	but
0	were
0	now
0	much
0	in
0	decay
0	,
0	but
0	still
0	preserved
0	all
0	the
0	appearances
0	of
0	human
0	sacrifices
0	;

0	of
0	which
0	there
0	is
0	not
0	a
0	doubt
0	,
0	any
0	more
0	than
0	of
0	their
0	eating
0	the

0	of
0	their

0	,
0	which
0	they
0	call
0	savoury
0	meat
0	.

0	On
0	the
0	3d
0	of
0	February
0	,
0	the
0	day
0	after
0	we
0	took
0	our
0	departure
0	,
0	we
0	had
0	heavy
0	squalls
0	,
0	but
0	not
0	so
0	violent
0	as
0	to
0	force
0	us
0	to
0	part
0	company
0	.

0	On
0	the
0	4th
0	,
0	it
0	cleared
0	up
0	,
0	and
0	we
0	pursued
0	our

0	E.
0	N.
0	E.
0	having
0	pleasant
0	weather
0	,
0	and
0	a
0	favouring
0	gale
0	.

0	On
0	the
0	5th
0	,
0	our
0	men
0	had
0	pickled
0	pork
0	served
0	instead
0	of
0	their
0	ordinary
0	allowance
0	,
0	one
0	pound
0	per

0	a-day
0	,
0	with
0	a

0	and
0	a
0	half
0	of
0	yams
0	,
0	instead
0	of
0	bread
0	;

0	and
0	this
0	was
0	continued
0	to
0	them
0	for
0	seven
0	weeks
0	,
0	which
0	they
0	liked
0	much
0	better
0	than
0	their
0	ship
0	's
0	provisions
0	.

0	Nothing
0	material
0	occurred
0	till
0	The
0	9th
0	,
0	when
0	there
0	appeared
0	the
0	usual
0	signs
0	of
0	land
0	,
0	but
0	we
0	saw
0	none
0	,
0	and
0	continued
0	our
0	course
0	till
0	The
0	13th
0	,
0	when
0	we
0	tacked

0	30.

0	200

0	E.
0	But
0	,
0	On

0	we
0	stood
0	again
0	N.
0	by

0	with
0	a

0	breeze
0	.

0	During
0	this
0	interval
0	of
0	fine
0	weather
0	,
0	our
0	sail-makers
0	were
0	employed
0	in
0	getting
0	up
0	and
0	reviewing
0	the
0	sails
0	,
0	when
0	it
0	was
0	found
0	that
0	they
0	were
0	in
0	a
0	miserable
0	condition
0	,
0	being
0	eaten
0	through
0	by
0	the

0	Sometimes

0	five
0	or
0	six
0	leagues
0	.

0	At
0	half
0	after
0	one
0	,
0	P.
0	M.
0	we
0	bore
0	away
0	N.
0	E.
0	by
0	E.
0	for
0	a
0	bay
0	,
0	which
0	we
0	thought
0	we
0	saw
0	to
0	the
0	Eastward
0	.

0	As
0	we
0	approached
0	it
0	,
0	we
0	observed
0	several
0	smokes
0	and
0	fires
0	a
0	considerable
0	way
0	within
0	land
0	.

0	At
0	length
0	,
0	after
0	a
0	series
0	of
0	the
0	most
0	tempestuous
0	weather
0	that
0	any
0	ships
0	ever
0	experienced
0	for
0	so
0	long
0	a
0	time
0	,
0	we
0	discovered
0	an
0	inlet
0	,
0	the
0	mouth
0	of
0	which
0	was
0	not
0	more
0	than
0	two
0	miles
0	over
0	;

0	in
0	which
0	we
0	entered
0	,
0	and
0	found
0	it
0	a
PLACE-B	sound
0	,
0	which
0	narrowed
0	as
0	we
0	advanced
0	,
0	though
0	it
0	still
0	continued
0	of
0	a
0	considerable
0	depth
0	.

0	About
0	seven
0	in
0	the
0	evening
0	we
0	anchored
0	in
0	ninety-seven
0	fathom
0	water
0	,
0	and
0	was
0	presently
0	joined
0	by
0	the
0	Resolution
0	.

0	We
0	made
0	signs
0	for
0	n
0	=
0	"
0	215
0	"
0	/
0	&gt;
0	some
0	of
0	the
0	natives
0	to
0	come
0	on
0	board
0	;

0	but
0	this
0	they
0	declined
0	,
0	though
0	some
0	hundreds
0	soon
0	came
0	about
0	the
0	ships
0	,
0	to
0	which
0	they
0	appeared
0	to
0	be
0	no
0	strangers
0	,
0	as
0	they
0	give
0	us
0	to
0	understand
0	,
0	that
0	iron
0	was
0	what
0	they
0	valued
0	most
0	.

0	We
0	observed
0	likewise
0	,
0	that
0	their
0	weapons
0	were
0	headed
0	with
0	copper
0	,
0	and
0	their
0	arrows
0	with
0	iron
0	,
0	which
0	they
0	could
0	obtain
0	only
0	from
0	the
0	Russians
0	,
0	or
0	from
0	trade
0	with
0	the
0	Hudson
0	's
PLACE-B	Bay
PLACE-I	Company
0	.

0	Though
0	they
0	declined
0	coming
0	on
0	board
0	,
0	they
0	were
0	nevertheless
0	very
0	civil
0	;

0	and
0	when
0	they
0	took
0	their
0	leave
0	,
0	saluted
0	us
0	with
0	a
0	war-song
0	.

0	We
0	were
0	now
0	so
0	far
0	advanced
0	to
0	the
0	Northward
0	and
0	Eastward
0	,
0	as
0	to
0	have
0	reached
0	that
0	void
0	space
0	in
0	our
0	maps
0	,
0	which
0	is
0	marked
0	as
0	a
0	country
0	unknown
0	.

0	Early
0	in
0	the
0	morning
0	of
0	the
0	30th
0	,
0	the
0	boats
0	were
0	armed
0	and
0	manned
0	,
0	and
0	both
0	Captains
0	proceeded
0	to
0	examine
0	the
PLACE-B	Sound
0	,
0	in
0	order
0	to
0	find
0	a
0	convenient
0	place
0	to
0	refit
0	the
0	ships
0	,
0	which
0	had
0	suffered
0	materially
0	in
0	the
0	violent
0	gales
0	,
0	which
0	for
0	the
0	last
0	twenty
0	days
0	they
0	had
0	been
0	combating
0	,
0	at
0	the
0	hazard
0	of
0	being
0	hourly
0	dashed
0	to
0	pieces
0	upon
0	the
0	rocks
0	,
0	or
0	stranded
0	upon
0	the
0	shores
0	.

0	In
0	their
0	progress
0	they
0	were
0	fortunate
0	enough
0	to
0	discover
0	a
0	cove
0	,
0	the
0	most
0	convenient
0	that
0	could
0	be
0	wished
0	;

0	the
0	entrance
0	of
0	which
0	was
0	about
0	two
0	cables
0	length
0	,
0	bounded
0	by
0	high
0	land
0	on
0	each
0	side
0	,
0	and
0	furnished
0	with
0	wood
0	and
0	water
0	(
0	now
0	much
0	wanted
0	)
0	so
0	conveniently
0	situated
0	,
0	that
0	both
0	could
0	be
0	taken
0	on
0	board
0	at
0	less
0	than
0	a
0	cable
0	's
0	length
0	from
0	the
0	shore
0	;

0	but
0	,
0	though
0	now
0	within
0	the
0	distance
0	of
0	four
0	miles
0	,
0	it
0	was
0	four
0	o
0	'clock
0	in
0	the
0	evening
0	before
0	we
0	could
0	get
0	the
0	ships
0	properly
0	moored
0	,
0	owing
0	to
0	the
0	uncertainty
0	of
0	the
0	weather
0	,
0	and
0	the
0	violent
0	gusts
0	to
0	which
0	this
0	coast
0	is
0	subject
0	.

0	All
0	this
0	while
0	the
0	Indians
0	behaved
0	peaceably
0	,
0	and
0	apparently
0	with
0	much
0	friendship
0	.

0	They
0	brought
0	,
0	after
0	a
0	short
0	acquaintance
0	,
0	a
0	great
0	variety
0	of
0	valuable
0	skins
0	,
0	such
0	as
0	beaver
0	,
0	foxes
0	,
0	racoons
0	,
0	squirrels
0	,
0	reindeer
0	,
0	bears
0	,
0	and
0	several
0	others
0	,
0	with
0	which
0	we
0	were
0	but
0	little
0	acquainted
0	;

0	but
0	what
0	they
0	chiefly
0	desired
0	in
0	exchange
0	,
0	were
0	cutlery
0	wares
0	of
0	all
0	sorts
0	,
0	edge-tools
0	,
0	copper
0	,
0	pewter
0	,
0	iron
0	,
0	brass
0	,
0	or
0	any
0	kind
0	of
0	metal
0	,
0	with
0	the
0	use
0	of
0	which
0	they
0	were
0	not
0	unacquainted
0	.

0	All
0	our
0	people
0	were
0	now
0	employed
0	in
0	the
0	necessary
0	repairs
0	of
0	the
0	ships
0	,
0	and
0	in
0	cutting
0	wood
0	and
0	getting
0	water
0	on
0	board
0	,
0	while
0	the
0	gentlemen
0	diverted
0	themselves
0	in
0	shooting
0	and
0	botanizing
0	.

0	On
0	the
0	1st
0	of
0	April
0	,
0	about
0	four
0	in
0	the
0	evening
0	,
0	there
0	entered
0	the
0	cove
0	a
0	large
0	canoe
0	,
0	in
0	which
0	were
0	thirty
0	armed
0	Indians
0	,
0	who
0	,
0	on
0	their
0	first
0	appearance
0	,
0	began
0	a
0	war-song
0	,
0	and
0	when
0	they
0	had
0	finished
0	,
0	took
0	to
0	their
0	paddles
0	,
0	and
0	rowed
0	round
0	the
0	ships
0	,
0	having
0	first
0	stript
0	themselves
0	of
0	their
0	clothing
0	,
0	except
0	one
0	man
0	,
0	who
0	stood
0	upright
0	in
0	the
0	vessel
0	,
0	delivering
0	an
0	oration
0	,
0	of
0	which
0	not
0	a
0	man
0	on
0	board
0	could
0	understand
0	a
0	word
0	.

0	They
0	paddled
0	round
0	the
0	ships
0	several
0	times
0	,
0	as
0	if
0	led
0	by
0	curiosity
0	;

0	but
0	did
0	not
0	offer
0	to
0	molest
0	any
0	of
0	the
0	workmen
0	,
0	nor
0	did
0	they
0	offer
0	to
0	trade
0	.

0	But
0	all
0	hands
0	being
0	instantly
0	ordered
0	under
0	arms
0	,
0	these
0	new
0	visitors
0	were
0	seen
0	to
0	clothe
0	themselves
0	as
0	before
0	,
0	and
0	to
0	make
0	towards
0	the
0	ships
0	.

0	The
0	Orator
0	made
0	not
0	the
0	least
0	hesitation
0	,
0	but
0	mounted
0	the
0	ship
0	's
0	side
0	,
0	and
0	accosted
0	the
0	Captain
0	with
0	much
0	civility
0	,
0	and
0	after
0	receiving
0	some
0	presents
0	,
0	and
0	stopping
0	a
0	little
0	while
0	to
0	observe
0	the
0	artificers
0	,
0	he
0	took
0	a
0	very
0	polite
0	leave
0	,
0	descended
0	to
0	his
0	boat
0	,
0	and
0	was
0	landed
0	on
0	the
0	opposite
0	shore
0	of
0	the
PLACE-B	Sound
0	.

0	On
0	the
0	3d
0	,
0	a
0	large
0	body
0	of
0	Indians
0	were
0	seen
0	paddling
0	along
0	the
PLACE-B	Sound
0	,
0	mostly
0	armed
0	with
0	spears
0	from
0	20
0	to
0	30
0	feet
0	long
0	,
0	and
0	with
0	bows
0	and
0	arrows
0	very
0	neatly
0	made
0	.

0	On
0	their
0	nearer
0	approach
0	they
0	too
0	were
0	heard
0	to
0	tune
0	up
0	their
0	war-song
0	,
0	and
0	to
0	brandish
0	their
0	weapons
0	,
0	as
0	if
0	in
0	defiance
0	of
0	an
0	enemy
0	.

0	Their
0	number
0	was
0	alarming
0	;

0	there
0	being
0	not
0	less
0	than
0	between
0	3
0	and
0	400
0	of
0	them
0	in
0	their
0	war
0	canoes
0	,
0	who
0	we
0	apprehended
0	were
0	come
0	to
0	attack
0	us
0	;

0	but
0	we
0	afterwards
0	understood
0	they
0	were
0	come
0	to
0	attack
0	a
0	body
0	of
0	their
0	enemies
0	on
0	the
0	opposite
0	shore
0	,
0	whom
0	they
0	afterwards
0	engaged
0	,
0	and
0	returned
0	victorious
0	.

0	We
0	were
0	frequently
0	visited
0	by
0	such
0	parties
0	,
0	who
0	appeared
0	always
0	in
0	arms
0	,
0	but
0	never
0	offered
0	the
0	least
0	violence
0	.

0	They
0	brought
0	,
0	besides
0	skins
0	,
0	great
0	quantities
0	of
0	fish
0	,
0	with
0	plenty
0	of
0	game
0	,
0	which
0	we
0	purchased
0	of
0	them
0	for
0	glass
0	bowls
0	,
0	looking-glasses
0	,
0	nails
0	,
0	hatchets
0	,
0	or
0	whatever
0	utensils
0	or
0	toys
0	were
0	either
0	useful
0	or
0	ornamental
0	.

0	The
0	men
0	were
0	of
0	an
0	athletic
0	make
0	,
0	very
0	rough
0	to
0	appearance
0	,
0	but
0	more
0	civilized
0	than
0	from
0	their
0	aspect
0	there
0	was
0	reason
0	to
0	expect
0	.

0	To
0	iron
0	they
0	gave
0	the
0	name
0	of
0	te-tum-miné
0	,
0	and
0	to
0	other
0	metals
0	ché-à-poté
0	.

0	On
0	the
0	5th
0	,
0	the
0	water
0	,
0	which
0	was
0	excellent
0	,
0	was
0	so
0	conveniently
0	situated
0	,
0	that
0	by
0	erecting
0	a
0	stage
0	,
0	and
0	constructing
0	a
0	spout
0	,
0	we
0	could
0	convey
0	it
0	in
0	casks
0	into
0	the
0	ships
0	without
0	farther
0	trouble
0	.

0	This
0	facilitated
0	the
0	labour
0	of
0	the
0	waterers
0	,
0	and
0	shortened
0	our
0	stay
0	,
0	as
0	wood
0	was
0	conveyed
0	on
0	board
0	with
0	very
0	little
0	more
0	trouble
0	.

0	On
0	the
0	6th
0	it
0	blew
0	a
0	storm
0	,
0	and
0	the
0	tide
0	came
0	rolling
0	in
0	at
0	an
0	alarming
0	rate
0	;

0	it
0	presently
0	rose
0	eight
0	or
0	nine
0	feet
0	higher
0	than
0	usual
0	,
0	and
0	drifted
0	several
0	of
0	our
0	materials
0	from
0	the
0	shore
0	,
0	which
0	we
0	never
0	could
0	recover
0	;

0	and
0	at
0	nine
0	in
0	the
0	morning
0	the
0	Discovery
0	drifted
0	very
0	near
0	the
0	Resolution
0	,
0	and
0	very
0	narrowly
0	escaped
0	being
0	bulged
0	.

0	On
0	the
0	7th
0	,
0	the
0	artificers
0	again
0	resumed
0	their
0	labour
0	.

0	The
0	natives
0	continued
0	their
0	visits
0	,
0	and
0	besides
0	fish
0	,
0	furs
0	,
0	and
0	venison
0	,
0	brought
0	bladders
0	of
0	oil
0	,
0	which
0	were
0	greedily
0	purchased
0	by
0	the
0	men
0	.

0	With
0	this
0	they
0	made
0	sauce
0	for
0	their
0	salt-fish
0	,
0	and
0	no
0	butter
0	in
PLACE-B	England
0	was
0	ever
0	thought
0	half
0	so
0	good
0	.

0	During
0	our
0	stay
0	here
0	,
0	which
0	was
0	but
0	very
0	short
0	,
0	owing
0	to
0	the
0	time
0	lost
0	in
0	making
0	the
0	land
0	,
0	and
0	the
0	advanced
0	season
0	of
0	the
0	year
0	,
0	no
0	people
0	could
0	be
0	more
0	obliging
0	;

0	they
0	were
0	ready
0	to
0	accompany
0	the
0	gentlemen
0	,
0	who
0	delighted
0	in
0	shooting
0	,
0	in
0	their
0	excursions
0	,
0	and
0	to
0	shew
0	them
0	the
0	different
0	devices
0	they
0	made
0	use
0	of
0	to
0	catch
0	and
0	to
0	kill
0	their
0	game
0	;

0	they
0	sold
0	them
0	their
0	masks
0	,
0	their
0	calls
0	,
0	and
0	their
0	gins
0	,

0	no

0	of
0	their
0	methods
0	of
0	curing
0	the
0	skins
0	,
0	with
0	which
0	they
0	carried
0	on
0	a
0	traffic
0	with
0	occasional
0	visitors
0	;

0	in
0	short
0	,
0	a

0	and
0	communicative
0	people

0	They

0	sea-fowl
0	in

0	,
0	swans
0	,
0	eagles

0	a

0	of

0	,
0	of
0	which
0	we
0	had
0	never
0	seen
0	the
0	species
0	.

0	Nor
0	were
0	their
0	fishermen
0	more
0	reserved
0	than
0	their
0	hunters
0	;

0	they
0	pointed
0	out
0	the
0	haunts
0	of
0	the
0	different
0	sorts
0	of
0	fish
0	,
0	and
0	they
0	were
0	not
0	averse
0	to
0	helping
0	their
0	new
0	acquaintance
0	to
0	compleat
0	their

0	whenever
0	they
0	had
0	been
0	unsuccessful
0	in
0	filling
0	their
0	boats
0	.

0	They
0	had
0	not
0	hitherto
0	discovered
0	any
0	disposition
0	to
0	pilfer
0	;

0	but
0	on
0	the
0	10th
0	day
0	,
0	after
0	our
0	arrival
0	,
0	several
0	of
0	them
0	being
0	on
0	board
0	,
0	and
0	our
0	people
0	having
0	no
0	suspicion
0	of
0	their
0	honesty
0	,
0	one
0	of
0	them
0	watched
0	his
0	opportunity
0	to
0	slip
0	into
0	the
0	great
0	cabin
0	,
0	and
0	carry
0	off
0	the
0	Captain
0	's
0	watch
0	;

0	which
0	being
0	soon
0	missed
0	,
0	all
0	the
0	Indians
0	on
0	board
0	were
0	seized
0	,
0	their
0	boats
0	secured
0	and
0	searched
0	;

0	and
0	at
0	length
0	it
0	was
0	found
0	hid
0	in
0	a
0	box
0	on
0	board
0	one
0	of
0	their
0	canoes
0	,
0	which
0	the
0	offender
0	delivered
0	up
0	without
0	the
0	least
0	concern
0	.

0	This
0	watch
0	,
0	had
0	the
0	thief
0	been
0	permitted
0	to
0	carry
0	it
0	off
0	,
0	would
0	probably
0	have
0	been
0	parted
0	with
0	to
0	the
0	first
0	sailor
0	he
0	had
0	met
0	with
0	for
0	a
0	single
0	nail
0	.

0	About
0	the
0	same
0	time
0	another
0	Indian
0	made
0	free
0	with
0	a
0	bolt
0	from
0	the
0	armourer
0	's
0	forge
0	;

0	but
0	was
0	seen
0	in
0	the
0	fact
0	,
0	and
0	an
0	endeavour
0	made
0	to
0	wrest
0	it
0	from
0	him
0	;

0	but
0	he
0	instantly
0	jumped
0	over-board
0	,
0	and
0	gave
0	it
0	to
0	one
0	of
0	his
0	companions
0	,
0	who
0	was
0	making
0	off
0	with
0	it
0	,
0	till
0	fired
0	at
0	with
0	small
0	shot
0	,
0	which
0	brought
0	him
0	back
0	;

0	and
0	he
0	surrendered
0	it
0	,
0	but
0	with
0	such
0	a
0	fierceness
0	expressed
0	in
0	his
0	countenance
0	,
0	as
0	sufficiently
0	indicated
0	his
0	intent
0	.

0	In
0	a
0	moment
0	,
0	every
0	Indian
0	in
0	the
0	cove
0	disappeared
0	,
0	and
0	in
0	less
0	than
0	three
0	hours
0	more
0	than
0	900
0	of
0	them
0	assembled
0	in
0	the
PLACE-B	Sound
0	,
0	and
0	being
0	unclothed
0	,
0	(
0	which
0	is
0	their
0	custom
0	when
0	they
0	mean
0	to
0	engage
0	)
0	began
0	their
0	war-song
0	,
0	and
0	approached
0	the
0	ships
0	.

0	We
0	were
0	in
0	readiness
0	to
0	give
0	them
0	a
0	warm
0	reception
0	;

0	but
0	seeing
0	our
0	preparations
0	,
0	and
0	perhaps
0	not
0	liking
0	our
0	countenance
0	,
0	they
0	all
0	laid
0	down
0	their
0	arms
0	,
0	and
0	putting
0	on
0	their
0	clothes
0	,
0	came
0	peaceably
0	round
0	the
0	ship
0	,
0	without
0	offering
0	the
0	least
0	incivility
0	.

0	Being
0	in
0	great
0	want
0	of
0	masts
0	,
0	most
0	of
0	those
0	we
0	brought
0	out
0	with
0	us
0	being
0	sprung
0	,
0	our
0	carpenters
0	were
0	sent
0	into
0	the
0	woods
0	to
0	cut
0	down
0	such
0	trees
0	as
0	they
0	should
0	find
0	fit
0	for
0	their
0	purpose
0	.

0	This
0	they
0	did
0	without
0	the
0	least
0	interruption
0	from
0	any
0	of
0	the
0	inhabitants
0	.

0	They
0	found
0	trees
0	from
0	100
0	to
0	150
0	feet
0	high
0	,
0	without
0	a
0	knot
0	,
0	and
0	measuring
0	from
0	40
0	to
0	60
0	feet
0	in
0	circumference
0	.

0	In
0	these
0	trees
0	the
0	eagles
0	build
0	their
0	nests
0	.

0	When
0	they
0	had
0	cut
0	down
0	what
0	best
0	suited
0	their
0	purpose
0	,
0	the
0	great
0	difficulty
0	was
0	to
0	bring
0	them
0	to
0	the
0	ships
0	;

0	and
0	in
0	this
0	labour
0	they
0	were
0	assisted
0	by
0	the
0	natives
0	.

0	It
0	was
0	now
0	their
0	spring
0	,
0	and
0	the
0	weather
0	began
0	to
0	change
0	for
0	the
0	better
0	.

0	When
0	we
0	first
0	arrived
0	the
0	thermometer
0	was
0	as
0	low
0	as
0	38
0	½
0	,
0	and
0	now
0	This
0	20th
0	day
0	of
0	April
0	it
0	is
0	as
0	high
0	as
0	62
0	degrees
0	.

0	We
0	have
0	at
0	present
0	the
0	full
0	range
0	of
0	the
0	woods
0	,
0	the
0	snow
0	all
0	melted
0	away
0	,
0	and
0	the
0	rivers
0	open
0	.

0	We
0	found
0	plenty
0	of
0	game
0	,
0	and
0	catched
0	fish
0	in
0	abundance
0	.

0	April
0	22
0	.

0	This
0	morning
0	we
0	were
0	visited
0	by
0	a
0	large
0	body
0	of
0	Indians
0	,
0	who
0	had
0	come
0	from
0	a
0	great
0	distance
0	with
0	furs
0	,
0	and
0	other
0	articles
0	of
0	trade
0	.

0	These
0	were
0	warmly
0	clothed
0	with
0	cloaks
0	of
0	valuable
0	furs
0	,
0	that
0	reached
0	down
0	to
0	their
0	ancles
0	;

0	and
0	among
0	them
0	was
0	a
0	stately
0	youth
0	,
0	to
0	whom
0	the
0	rest
0	paid
0	great
0	respect
0	.

0	Him
0	our
0	Captain
0	invited
0	on
0	board
0	,
0	which
0	he
0	at
0	first
0	declined
0	;

0	but
0	after
0	shewing
0	him
0	some
0	axes
0	,
0	glass
0	bowls
0	,
0	looking-glasses
0	,
0	and
0	other
0	articles
0	that
0	excited
0	his
0	curiosity
0	,
0	he
0	suffered
0	himself
0	to
0	be
0	handed
0	into
0	the
0	ship
0	,
0	where
0	he
0	staid
0	some
0	time
0	,
0	admiring
0	every
0	thing
0	he
0	saw
0	.

0	While
0	these
0	continued
0	to
0	trade
0	,
0	it
0	was
0	remarked
0	,
0	that
0	no
0	other
0	Indians
0	came
0	in
0	sight
0	;

0	but
0	they
0	had
0	hardly
0	left
0	the
0	ship
0	,
0	when
0	another
0	body
0	of
0	Indians
0	appeared
0	,
0	more
0	than
0	double
0	the
0	number
0	of
0	the
0	former
0	,
0	who
0	hemmed
0	them
0	all
0	into
0	the
0	cove
0	,
0	and
0	stript
0	them
0	of
0	every
0	thing
0	they
0	had
0	about
0	them
0	,
0	and
0	then
0	came
0	and
0	traded
0	with
0	us
0	.

0	At
0	the
0	same
0	time
0	a
0	chief
0	,
0	who
0	had
0	attached
0	himself
0	to
PERSON-B	Capt.
PERSON-I	Cook
0	,
0	came
0	on
0	board
0	to
0	take
0	his
0	leave
0	,
0	and
0	received
0	a
0	present
0	,
0	for
0	which
0	in
0	return
0	he
0	presented
0	a
0	beaver-skin
0	of
0	much
0	greater
0	value
0	.

0	This
0	called
0	upon
0	the
0	Captain
0	to
0	make
0	a
0	considerable
0	addition
0	to
0	his
0	present
0	,
0	with
0	which
0	the
0	chief
0	was
0	so
0	pleased
0	,
0	that
0	he
0	pulled
0	off
0	his
0	beaver-skin
0	cloak
0	,
0	and
0	laid
0	it
0	at
0	his
0	feet
0	.

0	Struck
0	with
0	this
0	instance
0	of
0	generosity
0	,
0	the
0	Captain
0	fetched
0	him
0	a
0	new
0	broad
0	sword
0	with
0	a
0	brass-hilt
0	,
0	which
0	made
0	this
0	chief
0	compleatly
0	happy
0	.

0	On
0	the
0	26th
0	,
0	having
0	finished
0	the
0	repairs
0	of
0	the
0	ships
0	,
0	we
0	began
0	to
0	prepare
0	for
0	our
0	departure
0	;

0	the
0	tents
0	were
0	ordered
0	to
0	be
0	brought
0	on
0	board
0	,
0	the
0	astronomers
0	observatory
0	,
0	and
0	what
0	live-stock
0	we
0	had
0	yet
0	left
0	;

0	and
0	as
0	the
0	last
0	service
0	to
0	be
0	performed
0	,
0	we
0	cut
0	grass
0	for
0	their
0	subsistence
0	,
0	which
0	we
0	were
0	fortunate
0	enough
0	to
0	find
0	in
0	plenty
0	,
0	and
0	to
0	have
0	a
0	pretty
0	good
0	time
0	to
0	make
0	it
0	into
0	hay
0	.

0	We
0	also
0	,
0	by
0	the
0	assistance
0	of
PERSON-B	Mr.
PERSON-I	Nelson
0	,
0	whose
0	business
0	,
0	as
0	has
0	already
0	been
0	observed
0	,
0	was
0	to
0	collect
0	the
0	vegetable
0	and
0	other
0	curious
0	productions
0	of
0	the
0	countries
0	through
0	which
0	we
0	passed
0	,
0	were
0	enabled
0	to
0	stock
0	ourselves
0	with
0	a
0	large
0	proportion
0	of
0	culinary
0	plants
0	,
0	which
0	was
0	of
0	infinite
0	service
0	to
0	us
0	in
0	our
0	more
0	northerly
0	progress
0	.

0	And
0	now
0	having
0	all
0	things
0	in
0	readiness
0	we
0	began
0	to
0	tow
0	out
0	of
0	the
0	cove
0	into
0	the
PLACE-B	Sound
0	,
0	to
0	which
PERSON-B	Capt.
PERSON-I	Cook
0	gave
0	the
0	name
0	of
PERSON-B	King
PERSON-I	George
0	's
PLACE-B	Sound
0	,
0	and
0	with
0	a
0	light
0	breeze
0	and
0	clear
0	weather
0	to
0	proceed
0	on
0	our
0	voyage
0	:
0	but
0	we
0	had
0	scarce
0	reached
0	the
PLACE-B	Sound
0	,
0	when
0	a
0	violent
0	gust
0	from
0	E.
0	S.
0	E.
0	threw
0	us
0	into
0	the
0	utmost
0	confusion
0	.

0	All
0	our
0	boats
0	were
0	out
0	,
0	our
0	decks
0	full
0	of
0	lumber
0	,
0	and
0	night
0	coming
0	on
0	dark
0	and
0	foggy
0	,
0	our
0	danger
0	was
0	equal
0	to
0	any
0	we
0	had
0	hitherto
0	met
0	with
0	in
0	the
0	course
0	of
0	the
0	voyage
0	;

0	though
0	an
0	especial
0	Providence
0	seemed
0	to
0	attend
0	us
0	,
0	and
0	to
0	interpose
0	in
0	our
0	favour
0	:
0	for
0	by
0	this
0	storm
0	a
0	leak
0	was
0	discovered
0	in
0	the
0	Resolution
0	,
0	which
0	,
0	had
0	it
0	been
0	calm
0	weather
0	,
0	would
0	probably
0	have
0	proved
0	fatal
0	to
0	the
0	crew
0	.

0	Having
0	cleared
0	the
PLACE-B	Sound
0	,
0	we
0	shaped
0	our
0	course
0	to
0	the
0	Westward
0	,
0	and
0	so
0	continued
0	till
0	day-light
0	,
0	when
0	,
0	seeing
0	nothing
0	of
0	the
0	Resolution
0	,
0	we
0	shortened
0	sail
0	;

0	and
0	before
0	noon
0	she
0	came
0	in
0	sight
0	,
0	seemingly
0	in
0	distress
0	.

0	The
0	storm
0	continuing
0	,
0	we
0	pursued
0	our
0	course
0	to
0	the
0	North-westward
0	,
0	till
0	May
0	1st
0	,
0	when
0	the
0	weather
0	became
0	fair
0	,
0	and
0	we
0	proceeded
0	with
0	a
0	pleasant
0	breeze
0	.

0	Being
0	now
0	at
0	leisure
0	to
0	recollect
0	what
0	observations
0	occurred
0	at
0	the
0	harbour
0	we
0	have
0	just
0	left
0	,
0	the
0	curious
0	reader
0	will
0	not
0	be
0	displeased
0	with
0	a
0	short
0	relation
0	.

0	When
0	we
0	first
0	arrived
0	in
0	the
PLACE-B	Sound
0	,
0	the
0	rough

0	in

0	,
0	a
0	knife
0	about

0	inches

0	We

0	some

0	fond

0	dancing
0	and
0	tumbling
0	in
0	a
0	bearish
0	way
0	.

0	Their
0	canoes
0	were
0	of

0	,
0	many
0	of

0	from
0	30

0	40
0	yards

0	,
0	made

0	trees
0	,
0	of

0	their

0	from
0	four
0	to
0	five
0	feet
0	over

0	,
0	but
0	the
0	stem
0	much
0	higher
0	than
0	the

0	They
0	were
0	strengthened
0	by
0	bars
0	of

0	,
0	or
0	stretchers
0	,
0	placed
0	across
0	at

0	,
0	and
0	were

0	about
0	six
0	feet

0	,
0	swelling

0	but
0	sharp
0	at
0	the

0	Some
0	of

0	were
0	roughly
0	carved

0	the
0	figures
0	of
0	the
0	sun
0	,
0	moon
0	,
0	and
0	stars
0	,
0	probably
0	the
0	objects
0	of
0	their
0	worship
0	;

0	but
0	what
0	was
0	remarkable
0	,
0	they
0	had
0	no
0	out-riggers
0	to
0	prevent
0	their
0	oversetting
0	,
0	like
0	those
0	of

0	.

0	The
0	women
0	are
0	much
0	more
0	delicate

0	curiously
0	woven
0	with
0	the
0	hair
0	of
0	wild
0	beasts
0	,
0	intermixed
0	with
0	the
0	most
0	beautiful
0	furs
0	.

0	We
0	saw
0	but
0	few
0	of
0	them
0	during
0	our
0	stay
0	,
0	and
0	those
0	who
0	came
0	in

0	were
0	rather
0	in
0	years
0	;

0	they
0	were
0	,
0	however
0	,
0	much
0	fairer
0	than
0	the
0	men
0	;

0	and
0	even
0	fairer
0	than
0	many
0	of
0	the
0	men
0	we
0	had
0	on
0	board
0	.

0	Their
0	employment
0	seems
0	chiefly
0	confined
0	at

0	We

0	and
0	the

0	On

0	,
0	in
0	the

0	,
0	the

0	we

0	in

0	by
0	a

0	,
0	which
0	increased
0	so
0	fast
0	upon
0	them
0	,
0	that
0	it
0	baffled
0	the

0	of
0	all
0	the

0	they
0	had
0	on

0	gaining

0	considerably
0	,
0	though
0	every
0	man
0	in
0	the
0	ship
0	,
0	even
0	to
0	the
0	Captain
0	,
0	took
0	it
0	in
0	turn
0	to

0	at
0	the

0	but
0	what
0	was
0	astonishing
0	,
0	it
0	had
0	now
0	stopt
0	of

0	,
0	without

0	.

0	However
0	,
PERSON-B	Capt.
PERSON-I	Cook
0	gave

0	We

0	not

0	of

0	we

0	On

0	Great

0	On

0	a

0	to
0	which
0	our

PLACE-I	Hinchinbroke
0	,
0	and
0	saw
0	the

0	to

0	northward
0	.

0	About

0	A.

0	at

0	About

0	we

0	met
0	a

0	,
0	and
0	the
0	wind
0	much
0	in
0	our
0	favour
0	,
0	we
0	with
0	difficulty
0	stemmed
0	the
0	tide
0	,
0	and
0	before
0	six
0	in
0	the
0	evening
0	,
0	the
0	Resolution
0	opened
0	a
0	close
0	harbour
0	or
0	bay
0	,
0	that
0	trended
0	to
0	the

0	round
0	a

0	point
0	of

0	was
0	soon
0	followed
0	by
0	the
0	Discovery
0	.

0	Here
0	both
0	ships
0	cast
0	anchor
0	close
0	under
0	the
0	lee
0	of
0	the
0	land
0	,
0	which
0	we
0	had
0	scarce
0	accomplished
0	,
0	before
0	the
0	boats
0	were
0	ordered
0	out
0	,
0	and
0	some
0	,
0	eager
0	to
0	haul
0	the
0	seine
0	,
0	and
0	others
0	to
0	go
0	a
0	shooting
0	,
0	were
0	impatient
0	to
0	begin
0	,
0	when
0	unexpectedly
0	they
0	were
0	alarmed
0	by
0	four
0	canoes
0	,
0	in
0	which
0	were
0	between
0	20
0	and
0	30
0	Indians
0	not
0	more
0	than
0	two
0	miles
0	distant
0	,
0	and
0	rowing
0	with
0	all
0	their
0	might
0	towards
0	the
0	boats
0	,
0	who
0	not
0	being
0	prepared
0	for
0	such
0	an
0	attack
0	,
0	made
0	the
0	best
0	of
0	their
0	way
0	back
0	to
0	the
0	ships
0	.

0	As
0	the
0	Indians
0	neared
0	the
0	boats
0	,
0	they
0	began
0	their
0	war-song
0	,
0	as
0	their
0	custom
0	is
0	,
0	and
0	brandishing
0	their
0	arms
0	,
0	denounced
0	defiance
0	;

0	but
0	by
0	this
0	time
0	other
0	boats
0	armed
0	from
0	the
0	ships
0	,
0	had
0	joined
0	the
0	sportsmen
0	,
0	who
0	were
0	now
0	so
0	near
0	the
0	ships
0	as
0	to
0	be
0	out
0	of
0	danger
0	.

0	The
0	Indians
0	had
0	then
0	time
0	to
0	cool
0	;

0	they
0	retreated
0	to
0	the
0	opposite
0	side
0	of
0	the
0	harbour
0	,
0	and
0	in
0	a
0	very
0	little
0	time
0	returned
0	,
0	with
0	a
0	white
0	cloak
0	displayed
0	as
0	a
0	signal
0	of
0	peace
0	,
0	which
0	was
0	answered
0	by
0	a
0	white
0	flag
0	;

0	and
0	then
0	they
0	came
0	on
0	board
0	without
0	the
0	least
0	ceremony
0	.

0	Their
0	features
0	,
0	size
0	and
0	colour
0	differed
0	little
0	from
0	those
0	we
0	had
0	just
0	left
0	in
PERSON-B	George
0	's
PLACE-B	Sound
0	;

0	but
0	they
0	had
0	a
0	slit
0	between
0	their
0	lower
0	lip
0	and
0	chin
0	,
0	through
0	which
0	they
0	could
0	put
0	their
0	tongue
0	,
0	that
0	gave
0	them
0	the
0	appearance
0	of
0	having
0	a
0	double
0	mouth
0	.

0	Add
0	to
0	this
0	,
0	the
0	ornaments
0	they
0	wore
0	in
0	their
0	noses
0	and
0	ears
0	,
0	of
0	tin
0	and
0	copper
0	,
0	and
0	no
0	figures
0	upon
0	earth
0	could
0	be
0	more
0	grotesque
0	.

0	However
0	,
0	they
0	behaved
0	civilly
0	,
0	and
0	it
0	being
0	near
0	night
0	they
0	took
0	their
0	leave
0	,
0	promising
0	to
0	visit
0	us
0	again
0	in
0	the
0	morning
0	;

0	which
0	they
0	accordingly
0	did
0	,
0	bringing
0	with
0	them
0	the
0	very
0	same
0	forts
0	of
0	skins
0	which
0	we
0	had
0	purchased
0	of
0	the
0	Indians
0	at
0	our
0	former
0	harbour
0	,
0	and
0	which
0	they
0	readily
0	parted
0	with
0	for
0	any
0	thing
0	made
0	of
0	iron
0	,
0	though
0	they
0	were
0	rather
0	choice
0	.

0	These
0	were
0	clothed
0	with
0	the
0	skins
0	of
0	birds
0	neatly
0	sewed
0	together
0	,
0	and
0	they
0	had
0	besides
0	a
0	covering
0	madelike
0	parchment
0	,
0	which
0	in
0	rainy
0	or
0	snowy
0	weather
0	was
0	water
0	proof
0	,
0	so
0	that
0	no
0	wet
0	could
0	affect
0	them
0	.

0	Their
0	ordinary
0	canoes
0	too
0	had
0	coverings
0	of
0	the
0	same
0	kind
0	.

0	They
0	had
0	some
0	instruments
0	for
0	fishing
0	,
0	which
0	we
0	did
0	not
0	observe
0	among
0	the
0	more
0	southerly
0	Indians
0	;

0	such
0	as
0	harpoons
0	,
0	and
0	gigs
0	,
0	all
0	of
0	which
0	they
0	were
0	very
0	ready
0	to
0	part
0	with
0	,
0	as
0	well
0	as
0	their
0	clothing
0	,
0	of
0	which
0	,
0	though
0	valuable
0	to
0	us
0	,
0	they
0	made
0	but
0	little
0	account
0	.

0	These
0	were
0	chiefly
0	purchased
0	by
0	the
0	sailors
0	for
0	glass
0	beads
0	,
0	who
0	found
0	them
0	warmer
0	,
0	and
0	better
0	adapted
0	to
0	the
0	climate
0	than
0	any
0	of
0	their
0	other
0	clothing
0	.

0	They

0	these
0	they
0	refused
0	to
0	exchange
0	for
0	any
0	thing
0	we
0	offered
0	.

0	In
0	the
0	morning
0	of
0	the
0	13th
0	,
0	we
0	weighed
0	,
0	and
0	pursued
0	our
0	course
0	to
0	the

0	up

0	all
0	day
0	,
0	with

0	pleasing
0	hope
0	of
0	having
0	found
0	the
0	passage
0	of
0	which
0	we
0	were
0	in
0	search
0	.

0	In
0	our
0	way
0	we
0	passed
0	several
0	very
0	fine
0	rivers
0	that
0	emptied
0	their
0	waters
0	into
0	that
0	which
0	we
0	were
0	now
0	exploring
0	.

0	About
0	four
0	in
0	the
0	afternoon
0	,
0	we
0	came
0	to
0	an
0	anchor
0	in
0	18
0	fathom
0	water
0	,
0	and
0	were

0	with
0	Indians
0	who

0	to
0	plunder
0	;

0	but
0	finding
0	us
0	on
0	our
0	guard
0	,
0	they
0	sneaked
0	off
0	without
0	their
0	booty
0	.

0	Here
0	,
0	being
0	safely
0	moored
0	just
0	opposite
0	to
0	a
0	small
0	rivulet
0	of
0	excellent
0	water
0	,
0	the
0	boats
0	were
0	ordered
0	out
0	to
0	fill
0	the
0	empty
0	casks
0	,
0	and
0	the
0	carpenters
0	from
0	both
0	ships
0	were
0	set
0	to
0	work
0	to
0	find
0	out
0	the
0	leak
0	in
0	the
0	Resolution
0	;

0	and
0	after
0	a
0	most
0	painful
0	search
0	,
0	a
0	hole
0	was
0	discovered
0	in
0	the
0	ship
0	's
0	side
0	,
0	eaten
0	quite
0	through
0	by
0	the
0	rats
0	;

0	which
0	,
0	by
0	the
0	working

0	,
0	had

0	filled

0	To

0	This

0	the

0	two

0	to
0	darken

0	.

0	We
0	were

0	close
0	under

0	,
0	and
0	the
0	roaring
0	they
0	made
0	was
0	infinitely

0	brown

0	,
0	and
0	found

0	ebb
0	already
0	begun
0	.

0	It
0	ran
0	only
0	three

0	an

0	fell
0	upon

0	perpendicular
0	22
0	feet
0	.

0	Here
0	they
0	saw
0	an
0	opening
0	between
0	the
0	mountains
0	,
0	and
0	were
0	in
0	doubt
0	whether

0	opening
0	did

0	take
0	an
0	easterly
0	direction
0	through
0	the
0	above
0	opening
0	;

0	or
0	whether
0	that

0	was
0	only

0	,
0	and
0	that
0	the
0	main
0	channel
0	continued
0	its
0	northern
0	direction
0	.

0	Next
0	day
PERSON-B	Mr.

0	,
0	the

0	,
0	reported

0	the
0	inlet
0	contracted
0	to
0	the
0	breadth
0	of
0	one
0	league
0	by
0	low
0	land
0	,
0	through
0	which
0	it
0	continued
0	its
0	northerly
0	direction
0	;

0	that
0	he
0	proceeded
0	three
0	leagues
0	through
0	this
0	narrow
0	part
0	,
0	which
0	he
0	found
0	navigable
0	for
0	the
0	largest
0	ships
0	;

0	but
0	the
0	water
0	,
0	as
0	it
0	ran
0	down
0	,
0	fresh
0	.

0	He
0	landed
0	on
0	an
0	island
0	,
0	that
0	,
0	it
0	should
0	seem
0	,
0	divided
0	this
0	main
0	channel
0	,
0	and
0	a
0	branch
0	that
0	had
0	an
0	easterly
0	course
0	,
0	upon
0	which
0	he
0	found
0	current
0	bushes
0	,
0	with
0	the
0	fruit
0	already
0	(
0	June
0	)
0	set
0	;

0	and
0	some
0	other
0	fruit-trees
0	unknown
0	to
0	him
0	.

0	About
0	three
0	leagues
0	beyond
0	this
0	,
0	he
0	observed
0	another
0	separation
0	in
0	the
0	eastern
0	chain
0	of
0	mountains
0	,
0	but
0	still
0	thought
0	the
0	main
0	channel
0	preserved
0	its
0	northern
0	direction
0	.

0	To
0	get
0	a
0	nearer
0	view
0	of
0	the
0	eastern
0	branch
0	,
0	the
0	Resolution
0	weighed
0	,
0	and
0	plyed
0	up
0	before
0	high
0	water
0	;

0	but
0	the
0	wind
0	being
0	contrary
0	,
0	he
0	was
0	obliged
0	to
0	cast
0	anchor
0	,
0	and
0	having
0	dispatched
0	two
0	boats
0	to
0	make
0	observations
0	,
0	and
0	examine
0	the
0	tides
0	,
0	they
0	found
0	that
0	the
0	flood
0	set
0	strong
0	into
0	the
0	eastern
0	branch
0	,
0	which
PERSON-B	Capt.
PERSON-I	Cook
0	distinguished
0	by
0	the
0	name
0	of
0	River
0	Turnagain
0	;

0	and
0	that
0	the
0	ebb
0	came
0	out
0	with
0	still
0	greater
0	force
0	.

0	Being
0	now
0	convinced
0	,
0	that
0	no

0	to
0	be
0	expected
0	by
0	this

0	,
0	any
0	more
0	than
0	by
0	the
0	main
0	branch
0	,
PERSON-B	Capt.
PERSON-I	Cook
0	gave
0	orders
0	to

PERSON-I	King
0	to
0	land
0	on
0	the

0	point
0	of
0	the

0	land
0	,
0	there
0	to

0	,
0	and
0	take
0	possession
0	of
0	the
0	country
0	and
0	river
0	,
0	and
0	to
0	bury
0	in
0	the

0	a
0	bottle
0	,
0	containing
0	some
0	pieces
0	of
0	English
0	coin
0	,
0	of
0	the
0	year
0	1772,
0	and
0	a

0	,
0	on
0	which
0	was
0	inscribed
0	the

0	the
0	ships
0	,
0	and
0	the
0	date
0	of
0	the
0	discovery
0	.

0	In
0	the
0	mean
0	time
0	,
0	a
0	party
0	of
0	us
0	,
0	with
0	officers
0	,
0	attended
0	by
0	a
0	serjeant
0	's
0	guard
0	of

0	,
0	landed
0	on

0	easternmost
0	shore
0	,
0	in
0	order
0	to
0	reconnoitre
0	the
0	country
0	.

0	We
0	had
0	proceeded
0	more
0	than
0	four
0	miles
0	without
0	seeing
0	one
0	inhabitant
0	,
0	and
0	were
0	going
0	to
0	scour
0	the
0	woods
0	for
0	game
0	,
0	when
0	a
0	body
0	of
0	Indians
0	,
0	to
0	the
0	number
0	of
0	forty
0	or
0	fifty
0	,
0	rushed
0	out
0	of
0	an
0	adjoining
0	thicket
0	,
0	all
0	armed
0	after
0	their
0	manner
0	with
0	bows
0	and
0	spears
0	;

0	a
0	few
0	of
0	our
0	marines
0	discharged
0	their
0	pieces
0	over
0	their
0	heads
0	,
0	which
0	instantly
0	stopt
0	their
0	career
0	;

0	and
0	they
0	were
0	retreating
0	as
0	rapidly
0	as
0	they
0	came
0	on
0	,
0	when
0	the
0	officer
0	,
0	who
0	had
0	the
0	command
0	,
0	advancing
0	singly
0	grounded
0	his
0	piece
0	,
0	and
0	made
0	signs
0	for
0	them
0	to
0	halt
0	.

0	One
0	who
0	seemed
0	to
0	have
0	the
0	command
0	of
0	the
0	rest
0	,
0	turning
0	suddenly
0	about
0	,
0	observed
0	his
0	motions
0	,
0	and
0	understood
0	them
0	;

0	and
0	calling
0	to
0	the
0	rest
0	,
0	they
0	all
0	stopt
0	,
0	and
0	,
0	after
0	a
0	short
0	consultation
0	,
0	laid
0	down
0	their
0	arms
0	,
0	and
0	stripping
0	themselves
0	quite
0	naked
0	,
0	laid
0	their
0	clothes
0	down
0	by
0	them
0	.

0	This
0	we
0	understood
0	they
0	did
0	,
0	to
0	show
0	that
0	they
0	had
0	no
0	arms
0	concealed
0	.

0	We
0	then
0	advanced
0	,
0	and
0	entered
0	into
0	a
0	kind
0	of
0	dumb
0	discourse
0	,
0	of
0	which
0	we
0	could
0	understand
0	enough
0	to
0	know
0	that
0	they
0	wanted
0	us
0	to
0	accompany
0	them
0	to
0	their
0	town
0	,
0	which
0	we
0	very
0	readily
0	did
0	;

0	they
0	very
0	deliberately
0	put
0	on
0	their
0	clothes
0	,
0	and
0	then
0	shewed
0	us
0	the
0	way
0	.

0	When
0	we
0	arrived
0	,
0	we
0	found
0	a
0	number
0	of
0	wretched
0	huts
0	,
0	with
0	women
0	and
0	children
0	,
0	old
0	men
0	and
0	dogs
0	,
0	who
0	at
0	first
0	sight
0	of
0	us
0	,
0	were
0	more
0	frightened
0	than
0	their
0	masters
0	,
0	hanging
0	their
0	tails
0	,
0	and
0	sneaking
0	away
0	.

0	One
0	of
0	these
PERSON-B	Mr.
PERSON-I	Law
PERSON-I	,
PERSON-I	our
PERSON-I	Surgeon
0	,
0	purchased
0	.

0	These
0	huts
0	consisted
0	of
0	nothing
0	but
0	long
0	poles
0	,
0	rudely
0	constructed
0	into
0	the
0	form
0	of
0	a
0	hovel
0	,
0	and
0	covered
0	over
0	with
0	heathy
0	earth
0	.

0	For
0	a
0	door
0	,
0	they
0	had
0	a
0	hole
0	just
0	large
0	enough
0	to
0	creep
0	in
0	at
0	,
0	which
0	,
0	in
0	cold
0	weather
0	,
0	they
0	close
0	with
0	a
0	kind
0	of
0	faggot
0	.

0	Their
0	inner
0	apartments
0	were
0	holes
0	or
0	pits
0	dug
0	in
0	the
0	earth
0	,
0	and
0	divided
0	like
0	stalls
0	in
0	a
0	stable
0	.

0	Their
0	furniture
0	we
0	did
0	not
0	take
0	the
0	pains
0	to
0	survey
0	.

0	We
0	saw
0	some
0	bladders
0	full
0	of
0	blubber
0	or
0	fat
0	,
0	hanging
0	about
0	,
0	and
0	some
0	skins
0	of
0	beasts
0	;

0	also
0	,
0	dried
0	fish
0	in
0	plenty
0	.

0	We
0	likewise
0	saw
0	several
0	wooden
0	utensils
0	,
0	besides
0	their
0	arms
0	;

0	and
0	we
0	saw
0	quantities
0	of
0	salt
0	in
0	wooden
0	troughs
0	.

0	They
0	had
0	dried
0	flesh
0	,
0	too
0	,
0	probably
0	the
0	remains
0	of
0	their
0	winter
0	provisions
0	,
0	which
0	we
0	understood
0	they
0	eat
0	raw
0	,
0	and
0	some
0	of
0	which
0	they
0	offered
0	us
0	for
0	dinner
0	.

0	In
0	these
0	huts
0	,
0	or
0	holes
0	,

0	along
0	side
0	,
0	they
0	made
0	signs
0	for
0	us
0	to
0	drop
0	our
0	anchors
0	,
0	intimating
0	that
0	the
0	people
0	on
0	shore
0	would
0	be
0	glad
0	to
0	see
0	us
0	;

0	at
0	the
0	same
0	time
0	,
0	we
0	thought
0	we
0	heard
0	the
0	report
0	of
0	a
0	gun
0	.

0	Little
0	notice
0	,
0	however
0	,
0	was
0	taken
0	of
0	what
0	passed
0	.

0	The
0	people
0	from
0	the
0	gang-way
0	talked
0	with
0	the
0	men
0	,
0	one
0	of
0	whom
0	made
0	signs
0	for
0	letting
0	down
0	a
0	rope
0	,
0	to
0	which
0	he
0	tied
0	a
0	neat
0	box
0	,
0	curiously
0	made
0	up
0	with
0	small
0	twine
0	,
0	for
0	which
0	he
0	would
0	take
0	nothing
0	in
0	return
0	.

0	The
0	man
0	who
0	took
0	it
0	,
0	looked
0	upon
0	it
0	as
0	a
0	great
0	curiosity
0	;

0	and
0	,
0	after
0	the
0	Indians
0	were
0	gone
0	,
0	began
0	to
0	examine
0	the
0	contents
0	,
0	when
0	a
0	note
0	was
0	found
0	in
0	the
0	inside
0	,
0	which
0	was
0	immediately
0	carried
0	to
0	the
0	Captain
0	,
0	and
0	a
0	consultation
0	was
0	held
0	on
0	the
0	quarter-deck
0	to
0	endeavour
0	to
0	decypher
0	the
0	contents
0	;

0	but
0	none
0	on
0	board
0	the
0	Discovery
0	could
0	make
0	out
0	a
0	letter
0	.

0	The
0	ship
0	was
0	then
0	hove-to
0	,
0	three
0	guns
0	fired
0	,
0	and
0	a
0	jack
0	hoisted
0	to
0	the
0	mast-head
0	for
0	stopping
0	the
0	Resolution
0	.

0	This
0	being
0	observed
0	,
0	all
0	on
0	board
0	were
0	struck
0	with
0	fear
0	for
0	the
0	safety
0	of
0	the
0	Discovery
0	,
0	thinking
0	that
0	some
0	fatal
0	disaster
0	had
0	happened
0	,
0	and
0	that
0	she
0	was
0	going
0	to
0	the
0	bottom
0	.

0	Their
0	boat
0	was
0	instantly
0	hoisted
0	out
0	,
0	and
PERSON-B	Mr.
PERSON-I	Williamson
0	,
0	third
0	Lieutenant
0	,
0	came
0	in
0	all
0	haste
0	to
0	learn
0	the
0	cause
0	.

0	With
0	him
0	our
0	Captain
0	returned
0	,
0	and
0	related
0	what
0	had
0	happened
0	,
0	and
0	shewed
PLACE-B	Captain
PLACE-I	Cook
0	the
0	note
0	,
0	who
0	likewise
0	held
0	a
0	consultation
0	upon
0	it
0	,
0	and
0	it
0	was
0	handed
0	from
0	the
0	quarter-deck
0	to
0	the
0	gang-way
0	,
0	where
0	every
0	man
0	in
0	the
0	ship
0	might
0	see
0	it
0	;

0	but
0	not
0	a
0	man
0	could
0	make
0	out
0	more
0	than
0	something
0	like
0	the
0	date
0	1778
0	,
0	of
0	which
0	they
0	were
0	not
0	clear
0	.

0	We
0	therefore
0	continued
0	our
0	course
0	along
0	the
0	coast
0	as
0	the
0	land
0	trended
0	,
0	but
0	saw
0	no

0	,
0	nor
0	any
0	inhabitants
0	.

0	About
0	midnight
0	,
0	we
0	saw
0	a
0	vast
0	flame
0	ascend
0	from
0	a
0	burning
0	mountain
0	,
0	and
0	observed

0	On

0	early
0	in
0	the
0	morning
0	,
0	looking
0	out
0	a-head
0	,
0	we
0	saw
0	something
0	like
0	a
0	reef
0	before
0	us
0	,
0	and
0	fired
0	a
0	gun
0	for
0	the
0	Resolution
0	to
0	tack
0	;

0	happy
0	that
0	day-light
0	had
0	enabled
0	us
0	to
0	escape
0	the
0	danger
0	.

0	On
0	the
0	21st
0	,
0	we
0	steered
0	S.
0	W.
0	but
0	at
0	eight
0	A.
0	M.
0	finding
0	the
0	land
0	to
0	trend
0	more
0	to
0	the
0	Southward
0	,
0	we
0	altered
0	our
0	course
0	to
0	S.
0	S.
0	W.
0	the
0	extreme
0	of

0	and

0	.

0	About
0	two
0	in
0	the
0	afternoon
0	,
0	we
0	came
0	again
0	in
0	sight
0	of
0	the
0	two
0	burning
0	mountains
0	,
0	which
0	we
0	had
0	before
0	seen
0	,
0	but
0	at
0	a
0	great
0	distance
0	,
0	bearing
0	N.

0	Our

0	during

0	During
0	the
0	course
0	of
0	this
0	day
0	,
0	the
0	weather
0	being
0	fair
0	,
0	and
0	but
0	little
0	wind
0	,
0	the
0	men
0	were
0	employed
0	in
0	fishing
0	;

0	and
0	in
0	less
0	than
0	four
0	hours
0	caught
0	more
0	than
0	three
0	ton
0	weight
0	of
0	cod
0	and
0	holybut
0	,
0	some
0	of
0	the
0	latter
0	more
0	than
0	a
0	hundred
0	pounds
0	weight
0	.

0	Here
0	a
0	man
0	in
0	a
0	small
0	canoe
0	came
0	on
0	board
0	the
0	Resolution
0	.

0	He
0	bowed
0	and
0	pulled
0	off
0	his
0	cap
0	,
0	and
0	shewed
0	evident
0	signs
0	of
0	having
0	had
0	commercial
0	dealings
0	with
0	the
0	Russians
0	.

0	He
0	wore
0	a
0	pair
0	of
0	green
0	cloth
0	breeches
0	,
0	and
0	a
0	jacket
0	of
0	black
0	cloth
0	.

0	He
0	had
0	nothing
0	to
0	barter
0	,
0	except
0	a
0	grey
0	fox
0	skin
0	.

0	On
0	the
0	22d
0	,
0	our
0	men
0	were
0	employed
0	in
0	salting
0	and
0	barreling
0	up
0	,
0	for
0	future
0	use
0	,
0	what
0	the
0	ship
0	's
0	company
0	could
0	not
0	consume
0	while
0	fresh
0	,
0	which
0	proved
0	a
0	most
0	acceptable
0	supply
0	.

0	All
0	this
0	day
0	we
0	kept
0	our
0	course
0	S.
0	W.
0	by
0	S.
0	On
0	the
0	23d
0	,
0	in
0	the
0	evening
0	,
0	we
0	shaped
0	our
0	course
0	more
0	to
0	the
0	Westward
0	,
0	the
0	weather
0	thick
0	and
0	hazy
0	.

0	On
0	the
0	24th
0	,
0	little
0	wind
0	and
0	hazy
0	.

0	Saw
0	no
0	land
0	;

0	but
0	looking
0	over
0	the
0	ship
0	's
0	side
0	,
0	observed
0	the
0	water
0	to
0	change
0	to
0	a
0	milky
0	white
0	.

0	Sounded
0	,
0	and
0	found
0	ground
0	at
0	47
0	fathom
0	.

0	About
0	four
0	P.
0	M.
0	we
0	saw
0	two
0	very
0	high
0	islands
0	bearing
0	N.
0	W.
0	distance
0	about
0	five
0	leagues
0	,
0	and
0	could
0	discern
0	the
0	main
0	land
0	contiguous
0	.

0	We
0	bore
0	away
0	under
0	the
0	lee
0	of
0	the
0	Westernmost
0	,
0	and
0	continued
0	steering
0	all
0	night
0	S.
0	by
0	W.
0	On
0	the
0	25th
0	,
0	in
0	the
0	morning
0	,
0	we
0	changed
0	our
0	course
0	,
0	steering
0	S.
0	W.
0	as
0	the
0	land
0	trended
0	.

0	At
0	ten
0	the
0	same
0	morning
0	,
0	we
0	had
0	a
0	full
0	view
0	of
0	the
0	land
0	for
0	many
0	miles
0	,
0	but
0	saw
0	no
0	signs
0	of
0	houses
0	or
0	inhabitants
0	;

0	but
0	doubtless
0	,
0	though
0	the
0	country
0	appeared
0	rugged
0	and
0	barren
0	,
0	and
0	in
0	many
0	places
0	white
0	with
0	snow
0	,
0	there
0	were
0	many
0	people
0	in
0	the
0	inland
0	parts
0	.

0	About
0	seven
0	in
0	the
0	evening
0	we
0	could
0	see
0	land
0	at
0	a
0	great
0	distance
0	,
0	bearing
0	due
0	South
0	,
0	which
0	had
0	the
0	appearance
0	of
0	a
0	large
0	island
0	.

0	Hitherto
0	we
0	had
0	been
0	exploring
0	the
0	coasts
0	of
0	an
0	unknown
0	continent
0	;

0	unknown
0	,
0	at
0	least
0	,
0	to
0	our
0	European
0	geographers
0	:
0	though
0	we
0	shall
0	see
0	by
0	the
0	sequel
0	,
0	that
0	it
0	was
0	not
0	wholly
0	unexplored
0	by
0	the
0	Asiatic
0	Russians
0	.

0	Towards
0	night
0	,
0	though
0	it
0	had
0	been
0	perfectly
0	clear
0	all
0	day
0	,
0	the
0	air
0	began
0	to
0	thicken
0	,
0	and
0	by
0	ten
0	at
0	night
0	the
0	fog
0	was
0	so
0	thick
0	that
0	we
0	could
0	not
0	see
0	the
0	ship
0	's
0	length
0	.

0	We
0	kept
0	firing
0	guns
0	,
0	burning
0	false
0	fires
0	,
0	and
0	standing
0	off
0	land
0	all
0	night
0	,
0	as
0	did
0	the
0	Resolution
0	;

0	and
0	in
0	the
0	morning
0	of
0	the
0	26th
0	,
0	when
0	the
0	fog
0	dispersed
0	,
0	we
0	found
0	ourselves
0	in
0	a
0	deep
0	bay
0	,
0	surrounded
0	by
0	high
0	lands
0	,
0	and
0	almost
0	ashore
0	under
0	a
0	high
0	mountain
0	,
0	which
0	we
0	had
0	not
0	before
0	discerned
0	.

0	Both
0	ships
0	instantly
0	dropt
0	anchor
0	in
0	24
0	fathom
0	water
0	,
0	blue
0	muddy
0	bottom
0	,
0	within
0	two
0	cables
0	length
0	of
0	the
0	shore
0	,
0	and
0	among
0	shoals
0	and
0	breakers
0	,
0	from
0	which
0	we
0	most
0	miraculously
0	escaped
0	.

0	For
0	some
0	time
0	we
0	stood
0	in
0	amazement
0	how
0	we
0	could
0	possibly
0	get
0	into
0	such
0	a
0	frightful
0	situation
0	.

0	But
0	being
0	in
0	it
0	,
0	for
0	our
0	own
0	safety
0	we
0	moored
0	both
0	ships
0	;

0	and
0	happy
0	it
0	was
0	we
0	used
0	that
0	precaution
0	;

0	for
0	a
0	gale
0	came
0	on
0	,
0	when
0	our
0	whole
0	existence
0	depended
0	upon
0	the
0	goodness
0	of
0	our
0	cables
0	.

0	In
0	the
0	evening
0	,
0	the
0	boats
0	were
0	got
0	out
0	,
0	and
0	the
0	Captain
0	,
0	with
0	several
0	other
0	gentlemen
0	,
0	went
0	on
0	shore
0	;

0	but
0	with
0	great
0	danger
0	were
0	landed
0	,
0	as
0	were
0	likewise
0	some
0	boats
0	from
0	both
0	ships
0	,
0	to
0	cut
0	grass
0	for
0	the
0	live
0	stock
0	that
0	yet
0	remained
0	.

0	They
0	afterwards
0	found
0	that
0	this
0	was
0	an
0	island
0	,
0	called
0	by
0	the
0	Russians
0	,
0	Vonulashka
0	Island
0	;

0	but
0	saw
0	no
0	inhabitants
0	.

0	In
0	their
0	excursion
0	the
0	gentlemen
0	shot
0	two
0	eagles
0	and
0	several
0	other
0	birds
0	of
0	various
0	sorts
0	,
0	and

0	On
0	the

0	,
0	at
0	three
0	A.
0	M.
0	it
0	ceased
0	blowing
0	,
0	and
0	the
0	weather
0	began
0	to
0	clear
0	.

0	At
0	six
0	we
0	unmoored
0	,
0	and
0	sailed
0	under
0	close
0	reefed
0	top-sails
0	,
0	directing
0	our
0	course
0	N.

0	for
0	an

0	we
0	saw
0	at

0	;

0	but
0	at
0	nine
0	the
0	wind
0	dying
0	away
0	,
0	we
0	anchored
0	again
0	in
0	25
0	fathom
0	water
0	,
0	loamy
0	sand
0	.

0	It

0	a
0	dead
0	calm
0	,
0	our
0	boats
0	were
0	ordered
0	out
0	,
0	and
0	some
0	gentlemen
0	went
0	again
0	on
0	shore
0	,
0	to
0	examine
0	the
0	island
0	more
0	closely
0	.

0	In
0	their
0	search
0	they
0	found
0	something

0	an

0	mansion
0	,
0	being
0	a
0	deep
0	pit
0	sunk
0	in
0	the
0	earth
0	,
0	with
0	some
0	poles
0	placed

0	after

0	a

0	to
0	creep
0	into
0	it
0	about
0	two
0	feet
0	square
0	.

0	In
0	it
0	they
0	found
0	the
0	bones
0	of
0	dried
0	fish
0	,
0	and
0	of
0	birds
0	,
0	and

0	it
0	a

0	where
0	there
0	had
0	been
0	a

0	,
0	but
0	all
0	had
0	the
0	appearance
0	of
0	being
0	long
0	deserted
0	.

0	They
0	also
0	found
0	the
0	rib
0	of
0	a
0	whale
0	,
0	about
0	eight
0	feet
0	long
0	,
0	which
0	it
0	was
0	not
0	easy
0	to
0	account
0	how
0	it
0	could
0	come
0	there
0	.

0	About
0	noon
0	the
0	gentlemen
0	returned
0	on
0	board
0	,
0	and
0	a
0	breeze
0	springing
0	up
0	from
0	the
0	Eastward
0	,
0	we
0	weighed
0	,
0	and
0	took
0	leave
0	of
0	this
0	dangerous
0	bay
0	,
0	to
0	which
PERSON-B	Capt.
PERSON-I	Cook
0	gave
0	the
0	name
0	of
PLACE-I	Providence
PLACE-I	Bay
0	,
0	as
0	it
0	was
0	owing
0	to
0	Providence
0	that
0	we
0	were
0	here
0	miraculously
0	preserved
0	from
0	perishing
0	.

0	We
0	had
0	pleasant
0	weather
0	all
0	day
0	,
0	and
0	the
0	land
0	high
0	all
0	round
0	us
0	.

0	We
0	sounded
0	all
0	the
0	afternoon
0	from
0	18
0	to
0	36
0	fathom
0	,
0	mostly
0	sandy
0	bottom
0	.

0	In
0	the
0	evening
0	we
0	saw
0	a
0	large
0	body
0	of
0	Indians
0	towing
0	a
0	whale
0	which
0	they
0	had
0	struck
0	,
0	who
0	were
0	too
0	busy
0	to
0	mind
0	us
0	till
0	late
0	,
0	when
0	two
0	canoes
0	came
0	along-side
0	and
0	traded
0	.

0	We
0	were
0	surprised
0	when
0	they
0	asked
0	us
0	for
0	tobacco
0	,
0	and
0	more
0	so
0	when
0	they
0	shewed
0	us
0	some
0	,
0	together
0	with
0	snuff
0	in
0	their
0	boxes
0	.

0	As
0	tobacco
0	was
0	a
0	precious
0	commodity
0	on
0	board
0	,
0	we
0	could
0	spare
0	them
0	little
0	,
0	but
0	for
0	that
0	little
0	they
0	were
0	thankful
0	,
0	and
0	departed
0	.

0	We
0	passed
0	several
0	islands
0	to
0	the
0	Eastward
0	,
0	very
0	high
0	and
0	mountainous
0	.

0	On
0	the
0	28th
0	,
0	in
0	the
0	morning
0	,
PERSON-B	Mr.
PERSON-I	Nelson
0	,
0	accompanied
0	by
0	several
0	other
0	gentlemen
0	,
0	went
0	on
0	shore
0	botanizing
0	;

0	they
0	found
0	great
0	variety
0	of
0	plants
0	and
0	flowers
0	peculiar
0	to
0	the
0	country
0	,
0	besides
0	others
0	,
0	with
0	which
0	we
0	were
0	all
0	well
0	acquainted
0	;

0	such
0	as
0	primroses
0	,
0	violets
0	,
0	currants
0	,
0	rasberries
0	,
0	juniper
0	,
0	and
0	many
0	other
0	Northern
0	fruits
0	,
0	which
0	were
0	now
0	all
0	in
0	blossom
0	.

0	They
0	found
0	also
0	a
0	bird
0	's
0	nest
0	,
0	with
0	five
0	small
0	eggs
0	,
0	not
0	unlike
0	a
0	sparrow
0	's
0	.

0	After
0	some
0	stay
0	they
0	came
0	again
0	on
0	board
0	,
0	and
0	the
0	wind
0	dying
0	away
0	,
0	and
0	the
0	Resolution
0	having
0	got
0	far
0	a-head
0	,
0	our
0	boats
0	were
0	employed
0	in
0	towing
0	us
0	,
0	when
0	a
0	strong
0	current
0	meeting
0	us
0	right
0	a-head
0	,
0	baffled
0	their
0	endeavours
0	.

0	This
0	current
0	ran
0	with
0	such
0	force
0	,
0	that
0	the
0	Resolution
0	,
0	unable
0	to
0	stem
0	it
0	,
0	cast
0	anchor
0	,
0	and
0	soon
0	after
0	was
0	joined
0	by
0	the
0	Discovery
0	.

0	Here
0	several
0	canoes
0	came
0	from
0	the
0	land
0	to
0	trade
0	,
0	and
0	made
0	signs
0	for
0	more
0	tobacco
0	,
0	of
0	which
0	our
0	own
0	men
0	were
0	in
0	great
0	want
0	.

0	About
0	noon
0	we
0	opened
0	on
0	a
0	fine
0	harbour
0	to
0	the
0	Westward
0	of
0	us
0	;

0	but
0	we
0	were
0	the
0	whole
0	afternoon
0	in
0	working
0	up
0	the
0	Race
0	,
0	as
0	it
0	was
0	called
0	,
0	from
0	the
0	rapidity
0	of
0	its
0	motion
0	,
0	and
0	the
0	strength
0	with
0	which
0	it
0	set
0	against
0	us
0	.

0	Our
0	first
0	attempt
0	to
0	stem
0	it
0	proved
0	fruitless
0	.

0	We
0	were
0	driven
0	as
0	far
0	back
0	as
0	the
0	place
0	from
0	whence
0	we
0	set
0	out
0	.

0	On
0	the
0	tide
0	's
0	turning
0	in
0	our
0	favour
0	,
0	we
0	made
0	a
0	second
0	attempt
0	,
0	and
0	succeeded
0	.

0	About
0	six
0	in
0	the
0	evening
0	,
0	we
0	cast
0	anchor
0	12
0	fathom
0	water
0	,
0	and
0	soon
0	after
0	came
0	to
0	moorings
0	.

0	We
0	were
0	,
0	in
0	less
0	than
0	an
0	hour
0	,
0	surrounded
0	with
0	more
0	than
0	thirty
0	canoes
0	,
0	with
0	rock
0	fish
0	and
0	dried
0	salmon
0	,
0	which
0	they
0	exchanged
0	for
0	beads
0	,
0	small
0	nails
0	,
0	or
0	any
0	thing
0	we
0	offered
0	them
0	.

0	They
0	had
0	likewise
0	some
0	very
0	pretty
0	baskets
0	of
0	their
0	own
0	making
0	,
0	with
0	other
0	utensils
0	,
0	which
0	plainly
0	indicated
0	a
0	communication
0	with
0	foreign
0	traders
0	.

0	On
0	the
0	29th
0	,
0	the
0	boats
0	were
0	employed
0	in
0	watering
0	the
0	ships
0	,
0	and
0	the
0	sail-makers
0	,
0	&amp;
0	amp
0	;

0	c.
0	began
0	to
0	overhaul
0	the
0	rigging
0	,
0	and
0	all
0	hands
0	were
0	employed
0	in
0	different
0	repairs
0	.

0	In
0	the
0	mean
0	time
0	several
0	Indians
0	hovered
0	round
0	the
0	ships
0	with
0	fish
0	n
0	=
0	"
0	246
0	"
0	/
0	&gt;
0	ready
0	dressed
0	,
0	which
0	they
0	presented
0	to
0	any
0	indiscriminately
0	who
0	would
0	accept
0	them
0	;

0	but
0	would
0	take
0	nothing
0	in
0	return
0	,
0	except
0	tobacco
0	or
0	snuff
0	were
0	offered
0	them
0	;

0	neither
0	did
0	they
0	offer
0	to
0	steal
0	or
0	take
0	any
0	the
0	most
0	trifling
0	thing
0	away
0	:
0	and
0	what
0	was
0	remarkable
0	,
0	not
0	a
0	woman
0	was
0	to
0	be
0	seen
0	,
0	nor
0	did
0	any
0	come
0	near
0	the
0	ship
0	during
0	our
0	stay
0	.

0	Our
0	Captain
0	took
0	notice
0	of
0	two
0	that
0	seemed
0	superior
0	to
0	the
0	rest
0	,
0	he
0	invited
0	them
0	on
0	board
0	,
0	and
0	with
0	much
0	entreaty
0	prevailed
0	on
0	them
0	to
0	enter
0	.

0	He
0	made
0	them
0	presents
0	of
0	a
0	few
0	beads
0	,
0	and
0	two
0	or
0	three
0	hands
0	of
0	tobacco
0	each
0	,
0	for
0	which
0	they
0	in
0	the
0	most
0	submissive
0	manner
0	expressed
0	their
0	gratitude
0	.

0	All
0	this
0	while
0	our
0	botanist
0	and
0	his
0	attendants
0	were
0	busily
0	employed
0	,
0	and
0	sent

0	of
0	celery
0	and
0	other
0	wholesome
0	herbs
0	on
0	board
0	,
0	as

0	On

0	to

PLACE-B	Captain
PLACE-I	Cook
0	intending

0	this
0	the

0	of

0	on

0	:

0	in

0	,
0	to

0	On

0	the

0	,
0	made
0	a

0	to
0	an

0	town
0	,
0	which
0	they
0	saw
0	at
0	the
0	distance
0	of
0	five
0	or
0	six
0	miles
0	,
0	situated
0	on
0	the

0	of
0	a
0	pleasant
0	little
0	hill
0	,
0	that

0	,
0	and

0	a

0	At

0	By

0	sit
0	down
0	;

0	and
0	when
0	they
0	were
0	seated
0	,
0	he
0	brought

0	fish
0	of
0	various
0	sorts
0	,
0	dried
0	and
0	fresh
0	,
0	and
0	some

0	,
0	which
0	,
0	however
0	,
0	they
0	declined
0	to
0	taste
0	:
0	observing
0	,
0	therefore
0	,
0	that
0	the
0	strangers
0	wanted
0	only
0	to
0	satisfy
0	their
0	curiosity
0	,
0	he
0	made
0	signs

0	and

0	These

0	On

0	,
0	though

0	we

0	tacked
0	;

0	and
0	as
0	the
0	fog
0	dispersed
0	,
0	we
0	saw
0	the

0	mountainous
0	and

0	,
0	with
0	neither

0	At

0	.

0	It
0	seemed

0	We
0	hastened
0	from

0	,
0	but
0	in
0	the

0	;

0	but
0	in
0	launching
0	it
0	the

0	we

0	the

0	our

0	to
0	be
0	sprung
0	.

0	Nothing

0	We

0	Fortunately

0	the

0	hung
0	over

0	of

0	And

0	it

0	On

0	we

0	Here

0	And
0	now
0	a

0	springing
0	up
0	in
0	our

0	,
0	we
0	quitted

0	seeing

0	trend

0	we

0	till
0	,

0	This

0	;

0	but
0	,
0	in

0	Out

0	which
0	split

0	our

0	and
0	both
0	Captains

0	three

0	their
0	caps
0	,
0	and
0	to

0	We

PERSON-B	Capt.

0	and
0	by

0	prevailed

0	In

0	,

0	a

0	Insensibly

0	a

0	some
0	were
0	blunted
0	.

0	The
0	use
0	they
0	made
0	of
0	these
0	was
0	,
0	probably
0	,
0	to
0	kill
0	small
0	animals
0	,
0	without
0	damaging
0	their
0	skins
0	.

0	The
0	bows
0	were
0	such
0	as
0	we
0	had
0	seen
0	used
0	by
0	the
0	American
0	Esquimaux
0	.

0	The
0	spears
0	or
0	spontoons
0	were
0	of
0	iron
0	or
0	steel
0	,
0	of
0	European
0	or
0	Asiatic
0	workmanship
0	,
0	curiously
0	ornamented
0	with
0	carvings
0	and
0	inlayings
0	of
0	brass
0	and
0	white
0	metal
0	.

0	Those
0	who
0	stood
0	ready
0	with
0	their
0	bows
0	and
0	arrows
0	,
0	had
0	their
0	spears
0	slung
0	over
0	their
0	right
0	shoulders
0	;

0	a
0	quiver
0	slung
0	over
0	their
0	left
0	with
0	arrows
0	;

0	some
0	of
0	their
0	quivers
0	were
0	extremely
0	beautiful
0	,
0	being
0	made
0	of
0	red
0	leather
0	,
0	on
0	which
0	were
0	very
0	neat
0	embroidery
0	,
0	and
0	other
0	ornaments
0	.

0	Several
0	other
0	things
0	,
0	and
0	in
0	particular
0	their
0	clothing
0	,
0	shewed
0	they
0	were
0	not
0	destitute
0	of
0	ingenuity
0	.

0	All
0	the
0	Americans
0	we
0	had
0	seen
0	since
0	our
0	arrival
0	on
0	that
0	coast
0	,
0	were
0	rather
0	low
0	of
0	stature
0	,
0	with
0	round
0	chubby
0	faces
0	,
0	and
0	high
0	cheek
0	bones
0	.

0	The
0	people
0	we
0	now
0	were
0	among
0	,
0	had
0	long
0	visages
0	,
0	and
0	were
0	stout
0	and
0	well-made
0	.

0	In
0	short
0	,
0	they
0	appeared
0	to
0	be
0	a
0	quite
0	different
0	nation
0	.

0	We
0	saw
0	neither
0	women
0	nor
0	children
0	;

0	nor
0	any
0	aged
0	,
0	except
0	one
0	man
0	,
0	who
0	was
0	bald-headed
0	,
0	and
0	carried
0	no
0	arms
0	.

0	The
0	other
0	seemed
0	to
0	be
0	picked
0	men
0	,
0	and
0	rather
0	under
0	than
0	above
0	the
0	middle
0	age
0	.

0	All
0	of
0	them
0	had
0	their
0	ears
0	bored
0	,
0	and
0	some
0	of
0	them
0	had
0	glass
0	beads
0	hanging
0	to
0	them
0	.

0	These
0	were
0	the
0	only
0	fixed
0	ornaments
0	we
0	saw
0	among
0	them
0	,
0	for
0	they
0	wore
0	none
0	to
0	their
0	lips
0	;

0	in
0	which
0	they
0	essentially
0	differ
0	from
0	their
0	American
0	neighbours
0	.

0	Their
0	clothing
0	consisted
0	of
0	a
0	cap
0	,
0	a
0	frock
0	,
0	a
0	pair
0	of
0	breeches
0	,
0	a
0	pair
0	of
0	boots
0	,
0	and
0	a
0	pair
0	of
0	gloves
0	,
0	all
0	made
0	of
0	the
0	skins
0	of
0	deer
0	,
0	dogs
0	,
0	seals
0	,
0	&amp;
0	amp
0	;

0	c
0	.

0	extremely
0	well
0	dressed
0	;

0	some
0	with
0	the
0	hair
0	or
0	fur
0	on
0	,
0	and
0	others
0	without
0	.

0	The
0	caps
0	were
0	made
0	to
0	fit
0	the
0	head
0	very
0	close
0	;

0	and
0	,
0	besides
0	these
0	caps
0	,
0	which
0	most
0	of
0	them
0	wore
0	,
0	we
0	got
0	from
0	them
0	some
0	hoods
0	made
0	of
0	the
0	skins
0	of
0	dogs
0	,
0	large
0	enough
0	to
0	cover
0	both
0	head
0	and
0	shoulders
0	.

0	Their
0	hair
0	seemed
0	to
0	be
0	black
0	,
0	but
0	their
0	heads
0	were
0	either
0	shaved
0	,
0	or
0	the
0	hair
0	cut
0	close
0	off
0	,
0	and
0	none
0	of
0	them
0	wore
0	any
0	beard
0	.

0	Of
0	the
0	articles
0	they
0	got
0	from
0	us
0	,
0	knives
0	and
0	tobacco
0	they
0	valued
0	most
0	.

0	We
0	found
0	the
0	village
0	composed
0	both
0	of
0	their
0	summer
0	and
0	their
0	winter
0	habitations
0	.

0	The
0	latter
0	are
0	exactly
0	like
0	vaults
0	,
0	the
0	floors
0	of
0	which
0	are
0	sunk
0	a
0	little
0	below
0	the
0	surface
0	of
0	the
0	earth
0	,
0	and
0	boarded
0	,
0	and
0	under
0	them
0	a
0	kind
0	of
0	cellar
0	,
0	in
0	which
0	we
0	saw
0	nothing
0	but
0	water
0	.

0	At
0	the
0	end
0	of
0	each
0	house
0	was
0	a
0	vaulted
0	room
0	,
0	which
0	we
0	took
0	to
0	be
0	a
0	store-room
0	.

0	Over
0	it
0	stood
0	a
0	kind
0	of
0	sentry-box
0	or
0	tower
0	,
0	composed
0	of
0	the
0	large
0	bones
0	of
0	large
0	fish
0	.

0	The
0	summer-huts
0	were
0	pretty
0	large
0	and
0	conical
0	.

0	The
0	framing
0	was
0	of
0	light
0	poles
0	and
0	bones
0	,
0	covered
0	with
0	the
0	skins
0	of
0	sea-animals
0	.

0	We
0	examined
0	the
0	inside
0	of
0	one
0	.

0	There
0	was
0	a
0	fire-place
0	just
0	within
0	the
0	door
0	,
0	near
0	which
0	lay
0	a
0	few
0	wooden
0	vessels
0	,
0	all
0	very
0	dirty
0	.

0	Their
0	bed-places
0	were
0	close
0	to
0	the
0	sides
0	.

0	Some
0	privicies
0	seemed
0	to
0	be
0	observed
0	,
0	for
0	there
0	were
0	several
0	partitions
0	made
0	of
0	skins
0	.

0	The
0	bed
0	and
0	bedding
0	were
0	of
0	deer-skins
0	,
0	and
0	most
0	of
0	them
0	were
0	dry
0	and
0	clean
0	.

0	About
0	these
0	habitations
0	were
0	several
0	stages
0	,
0	ten
0	or
0	twelve
0	feet
0	high
0	,
0	for
0	drying
0	their
0	fish
0	and
0	skins
0	out
0	of
0	the
0	reach
0	of
0	their
0	dogs
0	,
0	of
0	which
0	they
0	had
0	many
0	;

0	large
0	and
0	of
0	different
0	colours
0	,
0	with
0	long
0	soft
0	hair
0	,
0	like
0	wool
0	;

0	probably
0	used
0	in
0	drawing
0	the
0	sledges
0	,
0	for
0	sledges
0	they
0	had
0	in
0	their
0	huts
0	.

0	Perhaps
0	these
0	dogs
0	,
0	being
0	numerous
0	,
0	may
0	constitute
0	a
0	part
0	of
0	their
0	food
0	;

0	for
0	several
0	of
0	them
0	lay
0	dead
0	,
0	that
0	had
0	been
0	killed
0	that
0	morning
0	.

0	Their
0	canoes
0	are
0	of
0	the
0	same
0	sort
0	with
0	those
0	of
0	the
0	Northern
0	Americans
0	.

0	By
0	the
0	large
0	fish-bones
0	,
0	and
0	of
0	other
0	sea-animals
0	,
0	that
0	lay
0	scattered
0	about
0	,
0	it
0	appears
0	,
0	that
0	the
0	sea
0	supplies
0	them
0	with
0	the
0	greatest
0	part
0	of
0	their
0	substance
0	.

0	After
0	a
0	stay
0	of
0	about
0	two
0	or
0	three
0	hours
0	with
0	these
0	people
0	,
0	we
0	returned
0	to
0	our
0	ships
0	,
0	and
0	pur
0	+
0	sued
0	our
0	voyage
0	.

0	On
0	the
0	11th
0	we
0	passed
0	several
0	large
0	islands
0	to
0	the
0	eastward
0	of
0	us
0	,
0	and
0	at
0	the
0	same
0	time
0	left
0	the
0	extreme
0	point
0	of
0	the
0	northern
0	cape
0	of
PLACE-B	Asia
0	,
0	which
0	we
0	saw
0	trend
0	away
0	to
0	the

0	S.
0	as
0	far
0	as
0	the

0	mostly
0	high
0	land
0	,
0	barren
0	and
0	covered
0	with
0	snow
0	.

0	We
0	then
0	bore
0	away
0	to
0	the
0	north-east
0	,
0	sounding
0	from
0	5
0	to
0	6
0	fathom
0	,
0	and
0	about
0	3
0	P.

0	the

0	to

0	and
0	at
0	the
0	same
0	time
0	to
0	shallow
0	very
0	fast

0	we
0	came
0	to

0	and
0	sent
0	the
0	boats
0	out
0	to

0	,
0	who
0	soon
0	returned
0	,
0	finding
0	the
0	sea
0	to
0	deepen

0	they
0	proceeded
0	.

0	We

0	expose
0	them
0	to
0	the

0	six
0	minutes
0	:
0	and

0	and
0	the
0	ice
0	the
0	more
0	connected
0	.

0	About
0	2
0	in
0	the
0	afternoon
0	we
0	found
0	ourselves
0	surrounded
0	with
0	large
0	floating
0	islands
0	of
0	ice
0	,
0	which
0	,
0	like
0	clouds
0	in
0	the
0	sky
0	,
0	were
0	continually
0	varying
0	their
0	appearances
0	;

0	but
0	the
0	farther
0	we
0	ran
0	to
0	the
0	eastward
0	,
0	the
0	closer
0	the
0	ice
0	became
0	compacted
0	.

0	As
0	the
0	weather
0	was
0	now
0	clear
0	,
0	though
0	piercing
0	cold
0	,
0	we
0	could
0	see
0	the
0	ice
0	extending
0	on
0	every
0	side
0	E.
0	and
0	W.
0	as
0	far
0	as
0	the
0	eye
0	could
0	carry
0	.

0	We
0	stood
0	to
0	the
0	northward
0	,
0	and
0	being
0	embayed
0	,
0	we
0	observed
0	a
0	large
0	island
0	floating
0	,
0	with
0	the
0	tide
0	towards
0	us
0	,
0	whereon
0	was
0	supposed
0	to
0	rest
0	great
0	numbers
0	of
0	sea-monsters
0	.

0	Being
0	apprehensive
0	of
0	danger
0	,
0	the
0	signal
0	was
0	made
0	for
0	tacking
0	.

0	We
0	kept
0	off
0	and
0	on
0	all
0	night
0	.

0	Lat

0	70.41.

0	On
0	the
0	18th
0	,
0	hot
0	victuals
0	froze
0	while
0	we
0	were
0	at
0	table
0	;

0	and
0	this
0	weather
0	continued
0	for
0	some
0	days
0	.

0	Being
0	now
0	well
0	in
0	with
0	the
0	ice
0	,
0	and
0	having
0	lost
0	sight
0	of
0	land
0	,
0	we
0	kept
0	working
0	to
0	the
0	westward
0	.

0	At
0	noon
0	a
0	great
0	fog
0	came
0	on
0	,
0	but
0	soon
0	clearing
0	up
0	,
0	the
0	sun
0	made
0	his
0	appearance
0	,
0	and
0	we
0	had
0	an
0	observation
0	,
0	by
0	which
0	we
0	found
0	we
0	were
0	in
0	lat

0	70.54.
0	long
0	.

0	198.17

0	About
0	eight
0	at
0	night
0	it
0	blew
0	a
0	gale
0	,
0	with
0	heavy
0	snow
0	;

0	we
0	shortened
0	sail
0	,
0	and
0	stood
0	to
0	the
0	southward
0	.

0	The
0	19th
0	when
0	looking
0	round
0	in
0	the
0	morning
0	,
0	as
0	soon
0	as
0	the
0	fog
0	cleared
0	away
0	,
0	we
0	saw
0	nothing
0	but
0	fields
0	of
0	ice
0	covered
0	with
0	whole
0	herds
0	of
0	sea-lions
0	,
0	/
0	&gt;
0	sea-horses
0	,
0	and
0	other
0	amphibious
0	animals
0	,
0	to
0	the
0	number
0	,
0	as
0	it
0	was
0	thought
0	,
0	of
0	some
0	thousands
0	.

0	Thus
0	surrounded
0	,
0	a
0	signal
0	was
0	made
0	from
0	the
0	Resolution
0	to
0	bring
0	to
0	,
0	and
0	to
0	load
0	the
0	great
0	guns
0	,
0	while
0	the
0	boats
0	were
0	getting
0	ready
0	to
0	attack
0	these
0	hideous
0	looking
0	creatures
0	with
0	muskets
0	.

0	This
0	,
0	by
0	the
0	sailors
0	from
0	both
0	ships
0	,
0	was
0	accounted
0	sport
0	;

0	and
0	they
0	went
0	to
0	the
0	attack
0	with
0	as
0	much
0	alacrity
0	as
0	if
0	to
0	a
0	match
0	at
0	foot-ball
0	.

0	Orders
0	were
0	given
0	,
0	as
0	soon
0	as
0	the
0	great
0	guns
0	were
0	discharged
0	,
0	to
0	quicken
0	the
0	attack
0	with
0	the
0	musketry
0	as
0	fast
0	as
0	possible
0	.

0	In
0	a
0	few
0	minutes
0	not
0	a
0	creature
0	was
0	to
0	be
0	seen
0	upon
0	the
0	ice
0	but
0	such
0	as
0	were
0	killed
0	,
0	or
0	so
0	severely
0	wounded
0	as
0	not
0	to
0	be
0	able
0	to
0	crawl
0	to
0	the
0	open
0	sea
0	.

0	Some
0	lay
0	growling
0	on
0	the
0	ice
0	not
0	quite
0	dead
0	,
0	with
0	two
0	or
0	three
0	balls
0	through
0	their
0	heads
0	,
0	and
0	others
0	tumbling
0	about
0	with
0	horrible
0	vindictive
0	looks
0	,
0	threatening
0	destruction
0	to
0	whoever
0	should
0	approach
0	them
0	.

0	These
0	monsters
0	,
0	when
0	at
0	their
0	growth
0	,
0	are
0	in
0	length
0	from
0	the
0	head
0	to
0	the
0	hindmost
0	fin
0	from
0	eleven
0	to
0	twelve
0	feet
0	;

0	round
0	the
0	belly
0	from
0	twenty
0	to
0	twenty-six
0	feet
0	.

0	Four
0	long
0	stiff
0	fins
0	serve
0	them
0	for
0	feet
0	,
0	with
0	which
0	they
0	crawl
0	or
0	slide
0	upon
0	the
0	ice
0	,
0	and
0	move
0	with
0	wonderful
0	agility
0	;

0	two
0	large
0	tusks
0	,
0	at
0	the
0	distance
0	of
0	7
0	or
0	8
0	inches
0	apart
0	,
0	project
0	from

0	,
0	in
0	length
0	from
0	twenty
0	inches
0	to
0	two
0	feet
0	four
0	,
0	thick
0	at
0	the
0	root
0	,
0	and
0	tapering
0	to
0	a
0	point
0	;

0	their
0	forehead
0	resembles
0	that
0	of
0	a
0	bull
0	.

0	They
0	have
0	whiskers
0	on
0	each
0	side
0	the
0	mouth
0	,
0	about
0	six
0	inches
0	long
0	,
0	as
0	stiff
0	as
0	a
0	knitting-needle
0	,
0	with
0	which
0	they
0	raise
0	themselves
0	upon
0	the
0	ice
0	.

0	Their
0	eyes
0	are
0	small
0	.

0	They
0	have
0	no
0	teeth
0	;

0	nor
0	have
0	they
0	any
0	tail
0	.

0	They
0	have
0	,
0	like
0	the
0	seals
0	,
0	some
0	little
0	hair
0	upon
0	their
0	skins
0	,
0	but
0	very
0	thin
0	;

0	and
0	are
0	,
0	upon
0	the
0	whole
0	,
0	most
0	horribly
0	ugly
0	creatures
0	.

0	After
0	the
0	engagement
0	was
0	over
0	,
0	all
0	hands
0	were
0	employed
0	to
0	collect
0	the
0	carcasses
0	,
0	and
0	to
0	carry
0	them
0	on
0	board
0	;

0	but
0	what
0	was
0	thought
0	an
0	ill
0	reward
0	for
0	their
0	labour
0	,
0	orders
0	were
0	next
0	day
0	given
0	by
PERSON-B	Capt.
PERSON-I	Cook
0	to
0	substitute
0	the
0	flesh
0	of
0	these
0	sea-monsters
0	in
0	the
0	room
0	of
0	all
0	other
0	provisions
0	,
0	bread
0	or
0	flour
0	only
0	excepted
0	.

0	This
0	was
0	strongly
0	opposed
0	by
0	the
0	crew
0	of
0	the
0	Resolution
0	,
0	and
0	Capt.
0	Clerke
0	remonstrated
0	against
0	it
0	.

0	He
0	was
0	told
0	by
PERSON-B	Capt.
PERSON-I	Cook
0	,
0	that
0	he
0	might
0	do
0	as
0	he
0	pleased
0	on
0	board
0	his
0	own
0	ship
0	;

0	but
0	the
0	state
0	of
0	the
0	provisions
0	on
0	board
0	the
0	Resolution
0	made
0	it
0	necessary
0	,
0	and
0	that
0	he
0	himself
0	should
0	set
0	the
0	example
0	.

PERSON-B	Capt.
PERSON-I	Clerke
0	endeavoured
0	,
0	but
0	in
0	vain
0	,
0	to
0	enforce
0	the
0	order
0	,
0	and
0	the
0	matter
0	passed
0	on
0	without
0	any
0	serious
0	consequences
0	.

0	On
0	the
0	20th
0	we
0	tacked
0	ship
0	,
0	and
0	stood
0	to
0	the
0	westward
0	,
0	the
0	wind
0	much
0	against
0	us
0	.

0	We
0	tacked
0	every
0	two
0	hours
0	,
0	still
0	working
0	over
0	to
0	the
0	Asiatic
0	shore
0	,
0	with
0	a
0	view
0	to
0	examine
0	the
0	coasts
0	on
0	both
0	sides
0	,
0	before
0	we
0	returned
0	to
0	the
0	southward
0	.

0	We
0	were
0	now
0	in
0	lat
0	.

0	70.54.
0	long
0	.

0	194.55
0	.

0	On
0	the
0	21st
0	,
0	we
0	came
0	in
0	sight
0	of
0	the
0	continent
0	of
PLACE-B	America
0	,
0	extending
0	from
0	S.
0	by
0	E.
0	to
0	E.
0	by
0	S.
0	the
0	nearest
0	part
0	five
0	leagues
0	distant
0	.

0	We
0	continued
0	labouring
0	among
0	the
0	ice
0	till
0	the
0	25th
0	,
0	when
0	a
0	storm
0	came
0	on
0	,
0	which
0	made
0	it
0	dangerous
0	for
0	us
0	to
0	proceed
0	;

0	a
0	consultation
0	was
0	therefore
0	held
0	on
0	board
0	the
0	Resolution
0	as
0	soon
0	as
0	the
0	violence
0	of
0	the
0	gale
0	abated
0	,
0	when
0	it
0	was
0	unanimously
0	resolved
0	,
0	that
0	as
0	this
0	passage
0	was
0	impracticable
0	for
0	any
0	useful
0	purpose
0	of
0	navigation
0	,
0	which
0	was
0	the
0	great
0	object
0	of
0	the
0	voyage
0	,
0	to
0	pursue
0	it
0	no
0	farther
0	,
0	especially
0	in
0	the
0	condition
0	the
0	ships
0	were
0	in
0	,
0	the
0	winter
0	approaching

0	and
0	the
0	distance
0	from
0	any
0	known
0	place
0	of
0	refreshment
0	great
0	.

0	About
0	two
0	in
0	the
0	morning
0	of
0	the
0	26th
0	we
0	observed
0	a
0	great
0	body
0	of
0	ice
0	nearing
0	us
0	very
0	fast
0	,
0	and
0	in
0	a
0	few
0	hours
0	after
0	we
0	saw
0	the
0	ice
0	all
0	closed
0	as
0	far
0	/
0	&gt;
0	as
0	the
0	eye
0	could
0	carry
0	,
0	bearing
0	from
0	N.
0	E.
0	to
0	S.
0	W.
0	We
0	continued
0	to
0	sail
0	W.
0	S.
0	W.
0	On
0	the
0	28th
0	several
0	pieces
0	of
0	loose
0	ice
0	passed
0	us
0	,
0	one
0	of
0	which
0	came
0	soul
0	of
0	the
0	Discovery
0	,
0	and
0	shook
0	her
0	whole
0	frame
0	;

0	it
0	was
0	feared
0	she
0	had
0	received
0	considerable
0	damage
0	,
0	but
0	upon
0	the
0	carpenters
0	examining
0	her
0	sore
0	and
0	aft
0	,
0	nothing
0	was
0	found
0	amiss
0	.

0	We
0	now
0	took
0	leave
0	of
0	the
0	ice
0	for
0	this
0	season
0	,
0	directing
0	our
0	course
0	S.
0	S.
0	W.
0	On
0	the
0	29th
0	we
0	saw
0	land
0	in
0	the
0	morning
0	,
0	which
0	bore
0	from
0	N.
0	N.
0	W.
0	to
0	S.
0	W.
0	very
0	high
0	,
0	and
0	covered
0	with
0	snow
0	.

0	At
0	two
0	,
0	P.
0	M.
0	we
0	were
0	in
0	with
0	the
0	land
0	.

0	It
0	showed
0	itself
0	in
0	two
0	hills
0	,
0	like
0	islands
0	;

0	but
0	afterwards
0	seemed
0	connected
0	,
0	and
0	appeared
0	in
0	every
0	respect
0	like
0	the
0	opposite
0	coast
0	of
PLACE-B	America
0	.

0	In
0	the
0	low
0	ground
0	,
0	lying
0	between
0	the
0	high
0	land
0	and
0	the
0	sea
0	,
0	was
0	a
0	lake
0	,
0	extending
0	to
0	the
0	S.
0	E.
0	farther
0	than
0	we
0	could
0	see
0	.

0	The
0	30th
0	,
0	at
0	two
0	,
0	A.
0	M.
0	bore
0	away
0	E.

0	At
0	seven

0	At

0	,
0	P.
0	M.
0	saw
0	more

0	,
0	trending
0	to
0	the
0	southward
0	.

0	At
0	this
0	time
0	came
0	in
0	sight
0	of
0	a
0	narrow
0	channel
0	that
0	seemed
0	to
0	lead
0	to
0	the
0	lake
0	,

0	In

0	Here

PERSON-B	Capt.

0	On

0	.

0	We
0	hove

0	but
0	when

0	They

0	On

0	At

0	We

0	as
0	in
0	many

0	the

0	shallowed

0	We

0	On
0	the
0	10th
0	,
0	having
0	a
0	stiff

0	,
0	we
0	ran
0	right

0	,
0	for

0	This

PERSON-B	Capt.

0	which

0	,
0	with
0	a
0	variety
0	of
0	wild
0	berries
0	,
0	but
0	rather
0	over-ripe
0	.

0	He
0	observed
0	traces
0	of
0	foxes
0	and
0	deer
0	upon
0	the
0	beech
0	,
0	but
0	none

0	The

0	this

0	,
0	obtained
0	the

0	.

0	Several

0	,
0	and
0	one
0	came
0	off
0	,
0	to
0	whom
PERSON-B	Capt.
PERSON-I	Cook
0	gave
0	a
0	knife
0	,
0	and
0	asked
0	him
0	for
0	something
0	to
0	eat
0	.

0	The
0	man
0	paddled
0	off
0	;

0	and
0	meeting
0	with
0	another
0	man
0	,
0	with
0	two
0	dried
0	salmon
0	in
0	his
0	canoe
0	,
0	took
0	them
0	from
0	him
0	,
0	and
0	brought
0	them
0	to
0	the
0	Captain
0	.

0	On
0	the
0	11th
0	,
0	we
0	came
0	to
0	anchor
0	,
0	in
0	six
0	fathom
0	water
0	,
0	distance
0	from
0	the

0	about

0	.

0	In
0	the
0	night
0	,
0	we
0	saw
0	several
0	fires
0	,
0	but
0	no
0	Indians
0	came
0	off
0	to
0	us
0	.

0	On
0	the
0	12th
0	,
0	in
0	the
0	morning
0	,
0	the
0	boats
0	from
0	both
0	ships
0	were
0	sent
0	on
0	shore
0	,
0	where
0	they
0	saw
0	some
0	houses
0	of
0	a
0	wretched
0	construction
0	;

0	a
0	small
0	sledge
0	,
0	and
0	several
0	other
0	articles
0	belonging
0	to
0	the
0	Indians
0	,
0	but
0	none
0	of
0	the
0	natives
0	.

0	About
0	ten
0	,
0	they
0	returned
0	with
0	a
0	load
0	of
0	wood
0	,
0	which
0	they
0	found
0	drifted
0	on
0	the
0	beech
0	,
0	but
0	no
0	water
0	;

0	the
0	wood
0	had
0	drifted
0	from
0	the
0	Southward
0	,
0	for
0	we
0	saw
0	no
0	trees
0	,
0	but
0	black
0	spruce
0	.

0	We
0	then
0	stretched
0	over
0	to
0	the
0	other
0	shore
0	,
0	and
0	the
0	boats
0	were
0	again
0	sent
0	out
0	,
0	and
0	about
0	nine
0	in
0	the
0	evening
0	returned
0	,
0	loaded
0	with
0	wood
0	,
0	which
0	the
0	men
0	were
0	obliged
0	to
0	carry
0	through
0	the
0	water
0	on
0	their
0	shoulders
0	,
0	as
0	the
0	boats
0	could
0	not
0	come
0	within
0	half
0	a
0	mile
0	of
0	land
0	,
0	for
0	breakers
0	.

0	This
0	was
0	a
0	grievous
0	task
0	,
0	as
0	many
0	of
0	them
0	but
0	just
0	recovered
0	their
0	late
0	illness
0	.

0	This
0	day
0	several
0	natives
0	came
0	from
0	the
0	S.
0	S.
0	E.
0	side
0	,
0	in
0	large
0	canoes
0	,
0	having
0	great
0	quantities
0	of
0	salmon
0	,
0	dried
0	and
0	fresh
0	,
0	which
0	they
0	exchanged
0	for
0	blue
0	and
0	red
0	beads
0	,
0	needles
0	,
0	pins
0	,
0	knives
0	,
0	or
0	scissars
0	,
0	or
0	any
0	European
0	trinkets
0	that
0	were
0	offered
0	them
0	;

0	but
0	what
0	they
0	valued
0	most
0	was
0	tobacco
0	.

0	For
0	this
0	they
0	would
0	exchange
0	their
0	bows
0	and
0	arrows
0	,
0	their
0	warlike
0	instruments
0	,
0	and
0	whatever
0	else
0	they
0	valued
0	most
0	;

0	but
0	of
0	this
0	commodity
0	,
0	as
0	has
0	already
0	been
0	noticed
0	,
0	we
0	had
0	but
0	little
0	to
0	spare
0	.

0	We
0	were
0	again
0	obliged
0	to
0	change
0	our
0	station
0	,
0	and
0	stretch
0	to
0	the
0	other
0	shore
0	,
0	where
0	a
0	safe
0	anchorage
0	was
0	discovered
0	,
0	near
0	which
0	we
0	could
0	get
0	wood
0	and
0	water
0	with
0	the
0	greatest
0	ease
0	.

0	We
0	now
0	stood
0	more
0	to

0	This

0	On

0	which

0	A

0	Of

0	the

0	,
0	especially
0	when

0	was
0	to
0	be
0	stopped
0	,
0	and
0	this

0	substituted
0	in

0	This
0	occasioned

0	These

0	,
0	however

0	whales
0	of
0	a
0	prodigious
0	size
0	.

0	We
0	sounded
0	,
0	and
0	found
0	no
0	bottom
0	at
0	100
0	fathoms
0	.

0	Here
0	some
0	of
0	our
0	former
0	friends
0	came
0	off
0	to
0	us
0	,
0	and
0	being
0	informed
0	that
0	our
0	design
0	was
0	to
0	anchor
0	in
0	our
0	late
0	harbour
0	,
0	they
0	undertook
0	to
0	be
0	our
0	pilots
0	,
0	and
0	one
0	of
0	them
0	slept
0	all
0	night
0	on
0	board
0	the
0	Discovery
0	.

0	On
0	the
0	3d
0	,
0	in
0	the
0	morning
0	,
0	we
0	found
0	ourselves
0	right
0	a-breast
0	the
0	Race
0	,
0	and
0	saw
0	the
0	Resolution
0	just
0	within
0	the
0	entrance
0	.

0	About
0	two
0	in
0	the
0	afternoon
0	,
0	the
0	wind
0	and
0	tide
0	both
0	uniting
0	in
0	our
0	favour
0	,
0	we
0	safely
0	anchored
0	in
0	our
0	late
0	birth
0	.

0	All
0	hands
0	were
0	now
0	set
0	to
0	work
0	,
0	the
0	carpenters
0	in
0	stripping
0	the
0	sheathing
0	from
0	the
0	Resolution
0	to
0	examine
0	her
0	leaks
0	,
0	and
0	the
0	sail-makers
0	,
0	caulkers
0	,
0	and
0	riggers
0	,
0	in
0	their
0	respective
0	employments
0	,
0	for
0	which
0	there
0	was
0	great
0	need
0	,
0	both
0	ships
0	having
0	suffered
0	much
0	in
0	their
0	sails
0	,
0	seams
0	,
0	and
0	rigging
0	,
0	in
0	the
0	late
0	tempestuous
0	weather
0	,
0	and
0	in
0	the
0	icy
0	Northern
0	seas
0	;

0	but
0	what
0	gave
0	the
0	greatest
0	pleasure
0	to
0	the
0	seamen
0	,
0	was
0	the
0	success
0	they
0	met
0	with
0	in
0	fishing
0	,
0	whenever
0	the
0	weather
0	was
0	such
0	as
0	to
0	suffer
0	them
0	to
0	haul
0	the
0	seine
0	.

0	At
0	the
0	mouth
0	of
0	the
0	harbour
0	,
0	they
0	could
0	at
0	any
0	time
0	,
0	in
0	three
0	or
0	four
0	hours
0	,
0	fill
0	their
0	boats
0	with
0	holybut
0	of
0	an
0	enormous
0	size
0	;

0	one
0	of
0	them
0	,
0	sent
0	on
0	board
0	the
0	Resolution
0	,
0	during
0	our
0	stay
0	,
0	weighed
0	220
0	lb
0	.

0	—
0	Each
0	mess
0	had
0	now
0	a
0	small
0	cask
0	with
0	a
0	quantity
0	of
0	salt
0	given
0	them
0	,
0	in
0	order
0	to
0	make
0	some
0	provision
0	to
0	help
0	out
0	their
0	short
0	allowance
0	,
0	which
0	it
0	was
0	found
0	necessary
0	to
0	continue
0	till
0	their
0	arrival
0	in
0	the
0	tropical
0	islands
0	,
0	where
0	the
0	ships
0	might
0	again
0	be
0	furnished
0	with
0	a
0	frefh
0	supply
0	.

0	On
0	the
0	4th
0	,
0	our
0	Captain
0	went
0	on
0	board
0	the
0	Commodore
0	,
0	where
0	he
0	was
0	acquainted
0	by
PERSON-B	Capt.
PERSON-I	Cook
0	with
0	the
0	distress
0	of
0	the
0	Resolution
0	,
0	which
0	ever
0	since
0	the
0	hard
0	gale
0	on
0	the
0	26th
0	had
0	been
0	ready
0	to
0	founder
0	;

0	on
0	that
0	day
0	,
0	on
0	sounding
0	the
0	pumps
0	,
0	three
0	feet
0	water
0	were
0	found
0	in
0	the
0	well
0	;

0	and
0	judging
0	the
0	leak
0	to
0	proceed
0	from
0	the
0	same
0	place
0	as
0	before
0	,
0	the
0	carpenters
0	were
0	employed
0	in
0	search
0	of
0	it
0	,
0	when
0	,
0	to
0	their
0	great
0	surprize
0	,
0	they
0	found
0	the
0	full
0	casks
0	afloat
0	,
0	and
0	great
0	quantities
0	of
0	provisions
0	utterly
0	spoilt
0	.

0	Their
0	first
0	care
0	was
0	to
0	skuttle
0	the
0	bulk-heads
0	,
0	and
0	to
0	let
0	the
0	water
0	down
0	into
0	the
0	hold
0	,
0	and
0	then
0	the
0	pumps
0	were
0	kept
0	constantly
0	at
0	work
0	to
0	pump
0	it
0	out
0	;

0	but
0	this
0	was
0	beyond
0	their
0	power
0	;

0	they
0	could
0	gain
0	but
0	little
0	with
0	incessant
0	labour
0	,
0	and
0	when
0	they
0	came
0	into
0	harbour
0	had
0	28
0	inches
0	still
0	in
0	the
0	hold
0	.

0	The
0	carpenters
0	had
0	already
0	stript
0	the
0	sides
0	of
0	the
0	Resolution
0	16
0	feet
0	from
0	the
0	counter
0	forwards
0	,
0	where
0	they
0	found
0	the
0	inside
0	timbers
0	so
0	much
0	decayed
0	,
0	that
0	their
0	report
0	was
0	,
0	if
0	their
0	continuance
0	at
0	sea
0	had
0	been
0	necessarily
0	protracted
0	a
0	fortnight
0	longer
0	,
0	she
0	must
0	have
0	gone
0	to
0	the
0	bottom
0	.

0	We
0	had
0	still
0	much
0	to
0	do
0	,
0	our
0	articles
0	for
0	the
0	tropical
0	trade
0	were
0	nearly
0	all
0	exchanged
0	,
0	and
0	we
0	could
0	expect
0	no
0	supplies
0	of
0	provisions
0	without
0	an
0	equivalent
0	.

0	We
0	therefore
0	sent
0	a
0	small
0	spare
0	bower
0	anchor
0	on
0	shore
0	,
0	and
0	set
0	our
0	armourers
0	to
0	break
0	it
0	up
0	,
0	and
0	make
0	it
0	into
0	spikes
0	,
0	axes
0	,
0	hatchets
0	,
0	nails
0	,
0	and
0	other
0	tropical
0	merchandize
0	.

0	While
0	every
0	thing
0	was
0	getting
0	ready
0	,
0	the
0	officers
0	diverted
0	themselves
0	as
0	usual
0	with
0	shooting
0	and
0	surveying
0	the
0	country
0	;

0	and
0	here
0	they
0	found
0	amusement
0	enough
0	,
0	having
0	discovered
0	a
0	Russian
0	settlement
0	,
0	divided
0	only
0	by
0	a
0	neck
0	of
0	land
0	about
0	15
0	miles
0	over
0	,
0	and
0	a
0	bay
0	of
0	about
0	1
0	•
0	miles
0	,
0	which
0	they
0	had
0	to
0	cross
0	.

0	From
0	this
PLACE-B	settlement
PERSON-B	Capt.
PERSON-I	Cook
0	received
0	a
0	very
0	singular
0	pre
0	+
0	sent
0	.

0	It
0	was
0	a
0	rye-loaf
0	,
0	or
0	rather
0	a
0	pye
0	,
0	inclosing
0	some
0	salmon
0	very
0	nicely
0	seasoned
0	.

0	The
0	man
0	who
0	n
0	=
0	"
0	275
0	"
0	/
0	&gt;
0	brought
0	it
0	was
0	named
0	Derramoushk
0	,
0	and
0	brought
0	likewise
0	a
0	present
0	for
0	Capt.
0	Clerke
0	.

0	These
0	came
0	from
0	some
0	Russian
0	gentlemen
0	settled
0	in
0	that
0	neighbourhood
0	.

0	In
0	return
0	some
0	bottles
0	of
0	rum
0	,
0	wine
0	and
0	porter
0	were
0	sent
0	back
0	by
0	the
0	same
0	hand
0	;

0	and
0	Corporal
0	Lediard
0	of
0	the
0	marines
0	,
0	a
0	very
0	intelligent
0	person
0	,
0	sent
0	to
0	gain
0	information
0	,
0	who
0	soon
0	returned
0	with
0	three
0	Russian
0	seamen
0	and
0	furriers
0	,
0	who
0	,
0	when
0	they
0	first
0	discovered
0	us
0	at
0	a
0	distance
0	from
0	the
0	shore
0	,
0	were
0	apprehensive
0	that
0	we
0	were
0	Japanese
0	,
0	with
0	whom
0	their
0	nation
0	was
0	at
0	war
0	;

0	but
0	on
0	our
0	nearer
0	approach
0	,
0	they
0	were
0	convinced
0	from
0	the
0	trim
0	of
0	our
0	ships
0	that
0	we
0	were
0	strangers
0	;

0	they
0	were
0	therefore
0	encouraged
0	,
0	by
0	the
0	report
0	of
0	the
0	natives
0	,
0	to
0	make
0	themselves
0	known
0	,
0	and
0	to
0	offer
0	their
0	assistance
0	as
0	far
0	as
0	lay
0	in
0	their
0	power
0	.

0	These
0	were
0	received
0	with
0	open
0	arms
0	;

0	generously
0	entertained
0	,
0	and
0	a
0	very
0	friendly
0	intercourse
0	established
0	.

0	The
0	road
0	across
0	the
0	neck
0	of
0	land
0	was
0	rather
0	rugged
0	,
0	but
0	when
0	that
0	was
0	surmounted
0	,
0	the
0	communication
0	was
0	easy
0	.

0	Some
0	of
0	our
0	gentlemen
0	who
0	went
0	to
0	return
0	the
0	visit
0	,
0	were
0	met
0	by
0	an
0	officer
0	,
0	who
0	received
0	them
0	politely
0	,
0	and
0	directed
0	them
0	to
0	the
0	factory
0	,
0	where
0	,
0	besides
0	the
0	fort
0	,
0	they
0	found
0	a
0	Russian
0	bark
0	of
0	about
0	50
0	or
0	60
0	tons
0	,
0	eight
0	small
0	swivels
0	,
0	and
0	one
0	three
0	pounder
0	laid
0	up
0	for
0	the
0	winter
0	,
0	and
0	intended
0	for
0	Kamsha
0	•
0	ska
0	the
0	ensuing
0	summer
0	.

0	Our
0	gentlemen
0	were
0	here
0	shewn
0	the
0	stores
0	belonging
0	to
0	the
0	factory
0	,
0	consisting
0	of
0	skins
0	and
0	oil
0	;

0	their
0	coppers
0	for
0	boiling
0	the
0	oil
0	,
0	with
0	the
0	small
0	ware
0	with
0	which
0	they
0	trafficked
0	with
0	the
0	natives
0	by
0	way
0	of
0	exchange
0	.

0	Iron
0	instruments
0	of
0	war
0	are
0	prohibited
0	,
0	nor
0	do
0	they
0	suffer
0	any
0	offensive
0	weapons
0	of
0	any
0	kind
0	to
0	be
0	introduced
0	among
0	them
0	.

0	It
0	is
0	probable
0	therefore
0	,
0	that
0	the
0	long
0	knives
0	we
0	saw
0	in
0	the
0	possession
0	of
0	the
0	more
0	southerly
0	Indians
0	,
0	were
0	some
0	that
0	were
0	taken
0	from
0	those
0	unfortunate
0	Russians
0	,
0	who
0	,
0	on
0	the
0	first
0	discovery
0	of
0	this
0	continent
0	,
0	fell
0	a
0	sacrifice
0	to
0	the
0	savage
0	barbarity
0	of
0	the
0	natives
0	.

0	It
0	was
0	a
0	little
0	unfortunate
0	,
0	that
0	we
0	had
0	not
0	one
0	person
0	on
0	board
0	either
0	ship
0	that
0	had
0	the
0	most
0	distant
0	knowledge
0	of
0	the
0	Russ
0	language
0	;

0	every
0	thing
0	was
0	to
0	be
0	understood
0	by
0	signs
0	.

0	Our
0	officers
0	could
0	just
0	make
0	out
0	,
0	that
0	a
0	Russian
0	Captain
0	had
0	been
0	murdered
0	by
0	the
0	natives
0	,
0	and
0	that
0	the
0	Russians
0	had
0	taken
0	a
0	severe
0	revenge
0	,
0	and
0	had
0	laid
0	the
0	country
0	under
0	contribution
0	,
0	and
0	obliged
0	the
0	inhabitants
0	to
0	pay
0	a
0	certain
0	annual
0	tribute
0	in
0	skins
0	;

0	but
0	to
0	what
0	extent
0	they
0	had
0	subdued
0	the
0	country
0	,
0	or
0	in
0	what
0	year
0	,
0	they
0	could
0	not
0	at
0	all
0	understand
0	.

0	They
0	learnt
0	,
0	that
0	the
0	name
0	of
0	the
0	island
0	was
PLACE-B	Noo-Oonalashkah
0	,
0	in
0	lat
0	.

0	53.55.
0	long
0	.

0	167.30
0	.

0	E.
0	of
PLACE-B	Greenwich
0	;

0	that
0	they
0	had
0	another
0	settlement
0	to
0	the
0	Southward
0	,
0	and
0	other
0	vessels
0	that
0	were
0	constantly
0	employed
0	in
0	trading
0	with
0	the
0	natives
0	,
0	and
0	collecting
0	their
0	skins
0	and
0	oil
0	;

0	that
0	the
0	factory
0	was
0	supposed
0	to
0	clear
0	about
0	100,000
0	rubles
0	annually
0	by
0	this
0	trade
0	;

0	and
0	that
0	it
0	was
0	increasing
0	;

0	that
0	their
0	only
0	guard
0	consisted
0	of
0	about
0	40
0	Kamshatskadale
0	Russians
0	,
0	and
0	300
0	natives
0	,
0	over
0	whom
0	they
0	were
0	obliged
0	to
0	keep
0	a
0	watchful
0	eye
0	.

0	Our
0	gentlemen
0	's
0	entertainment
0	there
0	was
0	rather
0	friendly
0	than
0	sumptuous
0	;

0	they
0	had
0	dried
0	venison
0	,
0	dried
0	salmon
0	,
0	and
0	great
0	variety
0	of
0	other
0	fish
0	,
0	dressed
0	after
0	the
0	Russian
0	manner
0	;

0	their
0	biscuit
0	was
0	black
0	,
0	and
0	their
0	bread
0	rye

0	,
0	the

0	from

0	,
0	with
0	which
0	the

0	made
0	very
0	free
0	.

0	The
0	evening
0	;

0	being
0	spent
0	in
0	mutual
0	enquiries
0	,
0	by
0	which
0	neither
0	side
0	could
0	receive
0	much
0	satisfaction
0	,
0	they
0	were
0	shewn
0	to
0	the
0	apartments
0	prepared
0	for
0	them
0	,
0	where
0	they
0	slept
0	undisturbed
0	.

0	In
0	the
0	morning
0	they
0	renewed
0	their
0	enquiries
0	,
0	and
0	the
0	Russians
0	,
0	by
0	exhibiting
0	the
0	chart
0	of
0	their
0	discoveries
0	and
0	conquests
0	,
0	gave
0	our
0	gentlemen
0	more
0	satisfactory
0	information
0	than
0	they
0	could
0	otherwise
0	have
0	obtained
0	.

0	They
0	observed
0	a
0	remarkable
0	conformity
0	between
0	those
0	charts
0	exhibited
0	by
0	the
0	Russians
0	as
0	far
0	as
0	they
0	went
0	,
0	and
0	their

0	.

0	The
0	Russian
0	discoveries
0	extended
0	from
0	the
0	49th
0	to
0	the
0	64th
0	degree
0	of
0	Northern
0	latitude
0	,
0	by
0	which
0	the
0	impracticability
0	which
0	we
0	had
0	discovered
0	of
0	a
0	North-west
0	passage
0	by
0	any
0	strait
0	or
PLACE-B	sound
0	was
0	fully
0	confirmed
0	.

0	They
0	were
0	now
0	equally
0	communicative
0	to
0	each
0	other
0	;

0	the
0	Russian
0	gentlemen
0	were
0	desirous
0	of
0	knowing
0	the
0	names
0	of
0	the
0	navigators
0	and
0	ships
0	,
0	with
0	the
0	expedition
0	they
0	were
0	engaged
0	in
0	;

0	and
0	they
0	were
0	invited
0	on

0	to
0	receive
0	further
0	information
0	.

0	To
0	this
0	they
0	readily
0	agreed
0	;

0	and
0	as
0	soon
0	as
0	our
0	gentlemen
0	had
0	satisfied
0	their
0	curiosity
0	;

0	had
0	visited
0	the
0	Russian
0	houses
0	,
0	which
0	were
0	built
0	with
0	timber
0	,
0	and
0	those
0	of
0	the
0	natives
0	built
0	with
0	poles
0	and
0	earth
0	;

0	had
0	remarked
0	the
0	simplicity
0	of
0	the
0	latter
0	,
0	which
0	seemed
0	but
0	one
0	degree
0	above
0	the
0	level
0	of
0	the
0	beavers
0	they
0	hunted
0	;

0	and
0	of
0	the
0	former
0	,
0	that
0	was
0	little
0	more
0	than
0	a
0	degree
0	above
0	those
0	of
0	the
0	natives
0	;

0	they
0	set
0	out
0	upon
0	their
0	return
0	to
0	the
0	ships
0	,
0	accompanied
0	by
0	the
0	Russian
0	gentlemen
0	,
0	by
0	whom
0	they
0	had
0	been
0	entertained
0	.

0	About
0	five
0	in
0	the
0	evening
0	,
0	they
0	all
0	came
0	on
0	board
0	the
0	Resolution
0	:
0	the
0	Russian
0	gentlemen
0	were
0	received
0	by
PERSON-B	Capt.
PERSON-I	Cook
0	with
0	that
0	familiarity
0	and
0	politeness
0	that
0	was
0	natural
0	to
0	him
0	;

0	they
0	were
0	taken
0	into
0	the
0	great
0	cabin
0	,
0	where
0	both
0	Captains
0	with
0	their
0	principal
0	officers
0	and
0	gentlemen
0	were
0	assembled
0	to
0	entertain
0	them
0	,
0	and
0	where
0	the
0	bottle
0	was
0	pretty
0	briskly
0	pushed
0	about
0	,
0	as
0	that
0	was
0	the
0	principal
0	subject
0	in
0	which
0	the
0	strangers
0	could
0	bear
0	a
0	part
0	.

0	Here
0	they
0	were
0	interrogated
0	as
0	to
0	the
0	time
0	generally
0	taken
0	up
0	in
0	making
0	the
0	voyage
0	to
0	Kamshatska
0	,
0	which
0	they
0	answered
0	,
0	by
0	dividing
0	the
0	year
0	into
0	twelve
0	parts
0	,
0	and
0	pointing
0	to
0	the
0	two
0	middlemost
0	.

0	As
0	the
0	master
0	of
0	the
0	vessel
0	which
0	lay
0	at
0	Aegoochskach
0	was
0	of
0	the
0	company
0	,
0	he
0	was
0	asked
0	at
0	what
0	time
0	he
0	expected
0	to
0	arrive
0	at
0	Kamshatska
0	.

0	He
0	answered
0	about
0	the
0	9th
0	month
0	,
0	meaning
0	in
0	July
0	.

0	He
0	was
0	then
0	requested
0	to
0	take
0	letters
0	with
0	him
0	to
0	be
0	forwarded
0	to
PLACE-B	England
0	through
PLACE-B	Russia
0	,
0	should
0	it
0	so
0	happen
0	that
0	he
0	should
0	arrive
0	at
0	that
0	port
0	before
0	us
0	.

0	This
0	charge
0	he
0	readily
0	undertook
0	;

0	and
0	,
0	being
0	pretty
0	well
0	plied
0	with
0	liquor
0	,
0	they
0	slept
0	on
0	board
0	the
0	Resolution
0	,
0	and
0	next
0	day
0	came
0	on
0	board
0	the
0	Discovery
0	,
0	where
0	they
0	dined
0	,
0	and
0	,
0	being
0	amply
0	supplied
0	with
0	grog
0	,
0	went
0	jovially
0	away
0	in
0	the
0	afternoon
0	.

0	Before
0	our
0	departure
0	,
0	we
0	were
0	visited
0	by
0	the
0	Principal
0	of
0	the
0	Russian
0	factory
0	,
0	whose
0	name
0	was
0	Erasim
0	Gergorioffzin
0	Izmyloff
0	.

0	He
0	came
0	from
0	the
0	Southward
0	,
0	accompanied
0	by
0	a
0	number
0	of
0	Indian
0	canoes
0	,
0	laden
0	with
0	skins
0	,
0	who
0	on
0	coming
0	ashore
0	in
0	the
0	harbour
0	,
0	instantly
0	began
0	erecting
0	a
0	tent
0	,
0	which
0	in
0	half
0	an
0	hour
0	they
0	finished
0	,
0	covering
0	it
0	with
0	skins
0	.

0	He
0	was
0	received
0	on
0	board
0	the
0	Resolution
0	with
0	the
0	respect
0	due
0	to
0	his
0	rank
0	;

0	and
0	by
0	his
0	deportment
0	it
0	was
0	easy
0	to
0	perceive
0	that
0	he
0	was
0	of
0	family
0	.

0	He
0	was
0	a
0	young
0	gentleman
0	of
0	a
0	fair
0	complexion
0	,
0	and
0	graceful
0	stature
0	,
0	and
0	,
0	though
0	differing
0	but
0	little
0	in
0	point
0	of
0	dress
0	from
0	those
0	by
0	whom
0	we
0	had
0	been
0	visited
0	before
0	,
0	he
0	was
0	,
0	notwithstanding
0	,
0	very
0	different
0	in
0	his
0	manners
0	and
0	behaviour
0	.

0	He
0	had
0	travelled
0	much
0	,
0	but
0	chiefly
0	in
0	these
0	savage
0	countries
0	,
0	and
0	in
0	the
0	Northern
0	parts
0	of
PLACE-B	Asia
0	,
0	and
0	understood
0	,
0	and
0	could
0	talk
0	the

0	of
0	the
0	natives
0	,
0	but
0	could
0	speak
0	no
0	European
0	language
0	,
0	except
0	his
0	own
0	.

0	He
0	was
0	handsomely
0	entertained
0	on
0	board
0	both
0	ships
0	,
0	and
0	had
0	every
0	attention
0	paid
0	him
0	that
0	,
0	in
0	our
0	situation
0	,
0	he
0	had
0	reason
0	to
0	expect
0	;

0	nor
0	was
0	he
0	insensible
0	of
0	our
0	civilities
0	.

0	He
0	wrote
0	a
0	letter
0	,
0	directed
0	to
0	the
0	Governor
0	of
0	Kamshatska
0	,
0	which
0	he
0	requested
PERSON-B	Capt.
PERSON-I	Cook
0	to
0	deliver
0	.

0	It
0	contained
0	,
0	as
0	we
0	afterwards
0	understood
0	,
0	a
0	detail
0	of
0	his
0	own
0	mercantile
0	affairs
0	,
0	and
0	a
0	representation
0	of
0	us
0	,
0	as
0	trading
0	with
0	the
0	Indians
0	.

0	He
0	told
0	us
0	,
0	that
0	his
0	residence
0	was
0	on
0	the
0	coast
0	,
0	off
0	which
0	he
0	had
0	received
0	a
0	note
0	in
0	a
0	little
0	box
0	,
0	and
0	that
0	he
0	was
0	the
0	person
0	who
0	wrote
0	that
0	note
0	and
0	sent
0	it
0	.

0	Some
0	presents
0	reciprocally
0	passed
0	:
0	those
0	on

0	were
0	cloaks

0	on

0	tobacco
0	and
0	spirituous
0	liquors
0	,
0	of
0	both
0	which
0	we
0	observed
0	the
0	Russians
0	to
0	be
0	immoderately
0	fond
0	.

0	After
0	sleeping
0	on

0	From
0	this
0	gentleman
PERSON-B	Capt.
PERSON-I	Cook
0	received
0	much
0	useful

0	.

0	He

0	He

0	there

0	From

0	for

0	On

0	which

0	that
0	Capt.

0	,
0	much
0	against

0	,
0	was
0	under

0	of
0	substituting
0	stock-fish
0	in
0	the

0	of

0	;

0	but
0	we
0	were
0	no
0	sooner
0	well
0	in
0	with
0	the

0	,
0	than
0	we
0	were
0	visited
0	by
0	many
0	of

0	,
0	who
0	came
0	off

0	with
0	all

0	and
0	every

0	had

0	to
0	purchase
0	what
0	he
0	could
0	for
0	his
0	own
0	subsistence
0	.

0	This
0	diffused
0	a
0	joy
0	among
0	the
0	mariners
0	that
0	is
0	not
0	easy
0	to
0	be
0	expressed
0	.

0	From
0	a

0	and
0	discontent
0	visible
0	in
0	every

0	the
0	day
0	before

0	all
0	was

0	Fresh

0	and

0	past

0	are
0	instantly
0	forgotten

0	,
0	and
0	had

0	upon
0	this

0	,
0	and
0	for

0	.

0	This

0	discover
0	so

0	Nothing

0	At

0	made

0	This

0	on

0	In

0	,
0	from

0	Their

0	yet
0	on

0	On

0	suffered
0	much
0	in
0	their
0	masts

0	rigging
0	,
0	and
0	were
0	happy
0	at

0	,
0	as
0	well

0	ourselves
0	,
0	to
0	find
0	a

0	We

0	when
0	a
0	young
0	man
0	,
0	of
0	majestic

0	came

0	an

0	,
0	and
0	the

0	of

0	had
0	passsed
0	on

0	,
0	he
0	came
0	on
0	board
0	,
0	bringing
0	with

0	a
0	small
0	barbecued
0	hog
0	,
0	some
0	ready-dressed
0	bread-fruit
0	,
0	and
0	a

0	mantle
0	of
0	red
0	cloth
0	,
0	as
0	presents
0	to
0	the
0	Captain
0	;

0	and
0	in
0	return
0	was
0	complimented
0	with
0	several

0	,
0	looking-glasses
0	,

0	,
0	and
0	other

0	that

0	.

0	While

0	busy
0	in
0	admiring
0	every
0	thing
0	he
0	saw
0	on
0	board
0	the
0	Discovery
0	,
0	the
0	pinnace
0	was
0	ordered
0	out
0	,
0	and
0	he
0	with
0	his
0	attendants
0	were
0	taken
0	to
PERSON-B	Capt.
PERSON-I	Cook
0	,
0	where
0	he
0	found
0	another
0	Chief
0	,
0	of
0	a
0	still
0	more
0	graceful
0	aspect
0	,
0	named
0	Kaneena
0	.

0	All
0	these
0	were
0	received
0	with
0	all
0	possible
0	respect
0	.

0	In
0	the
0	mean
0	time
0	came
0	in
0	another
0	Chief
0	,
0	named
PERSON-B	Koah
0	,
0	who
0	was
0	soon
0	discovered
0	to
0	be
0	a
0	priest
0	;

0	but
0	who
0	,
0	in
0	his
0	youth
0	,
0	had
0	been
0	a
0	distinguished
0	warrior
0	.

0	After
0	entertaining
0	them
0	with
0	music
0	,
0	and
0	inviting
0	them
0	to
0	partake
0	of
0	such
0	refreshments
0	as
0	the
0	ship
0	afforded
0	,
0	and
0	making
0	them
0	some
0	handsome
0	presents
0	,
0	the
0	Captain
0	acquainted
0	them
0	with
0	his
0	wants
0	,
0	by
0	shewing
0	them
0	the
0	condition
0	of
0	his
0	ship
0	,
0	and
0	requesting
0	a
0	small
0	portion
0	of
0	ground
0	to
0	land
0	his
0	materials
0	,
0	and
0	to
0	erect
0	his
0	tents
0	.

0	This
0	request
0	was
0	readily
0	granted
0	,
0	at
0	the
0	same
0	time
0	giving
0	the
0	Captain
0	to
0	understand
0	,
0	that
0	the
0	great
0	King
0	was
0	absent
0	,
0	that
0	he
0	had
0	lately
0	been
0	at
0	war
0	with
0	the
0	King
0	of
0	the
0	neighbouring
0	island
0	of
0	Maw-whee
0	,
0	that
0	he
0	was
0	employed
0	in
0	settling
0	the
0	terms
0	of
0	peace
0	,
0	and
0	that
0	in
0	less
0	than
0	ten
0	days
0	he
0	was
0	expected
0	home
0	.

0	That
0	they
0	might
0	,
0	notwithstanding
0	,
0	land
0	whatever
0	they
0	thought
0	fit
0	;

0	and
0	that
0	the
0	ground
0	they
0	had
0	occasion
0	for
0	should
0	be
0	marked
0	out
0	and
0	taboo
0	'd
0	,
0	that

0	,
0	appropriated
0	to
0	their
0	use
0	,
0	without
0	any
0	of
0	the
0	natives
0	being
0	permitted
0	to
0	encroach
0	upon
0	it
0	.

0	Both
0	Captains
0	very
0	readily
0	embraced
0	the
0	offer
0	,
0	and
0	prepared
0	to
0	accompany
0	their
0	benefactors
0	to
0	the
0	town
0	near
0	which
0	they
0	wished
0	to
0	pitch
0	their
0	tents
0	.

0	Upon
0	their
0	landing
0	,
0	several
0	vacant
0	plats
0	of
0	ground
0	were
0	shewn
0	them
0	,
0	and
0	,
0	when
0	they
0	had
0	made
0	their
0	choice
0	,
0	stakes
0	were
0	ordered
0	to
0	be
0	driven
0	at
0	certain
0	distances
0	,
0	and
0	a
0	line
0	to
0	be
0	carried
0	round
0	,
0	within
0	which
0	the
0	common
0	people
0	were
0	forbidden
0	to
0	enter
0	,
0	under
0	the
0	severest
0	penalties
0	.

0	Matters
0	being
0	thus
0	amicably
0	settled
0	,
0	no
0	time
0	was
0	lost
0	on
0	our
0	part
0	to
0	get
0	every
0	thing
0	on
0	shore
0	.

0	The
0	tents
0	,
0	the
0	armourer
0	's
0	forge
0	,
0	the
0	masts
0	,
0	the

0	,
0	the

0	,
0	the

0	,
0	the

0	,
0	the

0	,
0	the
0	powder
0	,
0	in
0	short
0	,
0	every
0	article
0	that
0	wanted
0	either
0	to
0	be
0	reviewed
0	or
0	repaired
0	were
0	sent
0	on
0	shore
0	;

0	and
0	not
0	the
0	least
0	interruption
0	was
0	given
0	to
0	the
0	boats
0	employed
0	in
0	the
0	carriage
0	,
0	or
0	insult
0	offered
0	to
0	the
0	persons
0	who
0	conducted
0	them
0	.

0	On
0	the
0	contrary
0	,
0	the
0	Chiefs
0	offered
0	some
0	empty
0	houses
0	,
0	that
0	were
0	conveniently
0	situated
0	near
0	the
0	new
0	dock
0	(
0	if
0	that
0	may
0	be
0	so
0	termed
0	where
0	our
0	artificers
0	were
0	set
0	to

0	)
0	for
0	the
0	sick
0	to

0	their
0	recovery
0	.

0	No
0	strangers
0	were
0	ever
0	more
0	hospitably
0	received
0	.

0	On
0	the
0	morning
0	after
0	our
0	people
0	landed
0	,
0	six
0	large
0	double
0	canoes
0	were
0	seen
0	entering
0	the
0	harbour
0	at
0	a
0	great
0	rate
0	,
0	having
0	not
0	less
0	than
0	30
0	paddles
0	to
0	each
0	canoe
0	,
0	with
0	upwards
0	of
0	60
0	Indians
0	on
0	board
0	,
0	most
0	of
0	them
0	naked
0	.

0	Seeing
0	them
0	on
0	their
0	nearer
0	approach
0	making
0	towards
0	the
0	ships
0	,
0	the
0	Captains
0	ordered
0	the
0	guns
0	to
0	be
0	shotted
0	,
0	the
0	marines
0	to
0	be
0	drawn
0	up
0	,
0	and
0	every
0	man
0	to
0	be
0	ready
0	at
0	his
0	post
0	;

0	the
0	Indians
0	assembled
0	so
0	fast
0	,
0	that
0	before
0	noon
0	,
0	the
0	ships
0	were
0	surrounded
0	with
0	more
0	than
0	100
0	canoes
0	,
0	in
0	which
0	there
0	were
0	not
0	less
0	than
0	1000
0	Indians
0	.

0	They
0	at
0	first
0	traded
0	friendly
0	,
0	having
0	hogs
0	in
0	abundance
0	,
0	and
0	plenty
0	of
0	bread-fruit
0	,
0	plantains
0	,
0	bananoes
0	,
0	and
0	whatever
0	else
0	the
0	island
0	produced
0	;

0	but
0	they
0	had
0	not
0	been
0	there
0	long
0	,
0	before
0	a
0	large
0	stone
0	was
0	thrown
0	in
0	at
0	the
0	cabin-window
0	of
0	the
0	Discovery
0	,
0	by
0	an
0	invisible
0	hand
0	.

0	A
0	watch
0	was
0	instantly
0	set
0	,
0	and
0	in
0	less
0	than
0	half
0	an
0	hour
0	another
0	stone
0	was
0	thrown
0	at
0	the
0	caulkers
0	,
0	as
0	they
0	were
0	at
0	work
0	on
0	a
0	stage
0	on
0	the
0	ship
0	's
0	side
0	.

0	The
0	offender
0	was
0	seen
0	,
0	and
0	in
0	sight
0	of
0	the
0	Chiefs
0	,
0	and
0	the
0	whole
0	multitude
0	,
0	he
0	was
0	seized
0	,
0	brought
0	on
0	board
0	,
0	tied
0	to
0	the
0	shrouds
0	,
0	and
0	punished
0	with
0	fifty
0	lashes
0	.

0	In
0	a
0	few
0	minutes
0	,
0	such
0	was
0	their
0	fright
0	,
0	there
0	was
0	not
0	an
0	Indian
0	to
0	be
0	seen
0	near
0	the
0	ships
0	.

0	—
0	Like
0	unlucky
0	boys
0	,
0	when
0	one
0	is
0	apprehended
0	for
0	some
0	naughty
0	trick
0	,
0	the
0	rest
0	commonly
0	fly
0	the
0	place
0	.

0	—
0	And
0	in
0	fact
0	,
0	these
0	people
0	are
0	in
0	many
0	respects
0	like
0	children
0	,
0	and
0	in
0	none
0	more
0	than
0	in
0	this
0	instance
0	.

0	Before
0	the
0	day
0	closed
0	,
0	they
0	all
0	again
0	returned
0	to
0	trade
0	,
0	and
0	,
0	when
0	night
0	approached
0	,
0	not
0	a
0	male
0	was
0	to
0	be
0	seen
0	;

0	but
0	swarms
0	of
0	females
0	,
0	who
0	came
0	to
0	sleep
0	on
0	board
0	,
0	though
0	much
0	against
0	the
0	will
0	of
PERSON-B	Capt.
PERSON-I	Cook
0	,
0	who
0	,
0	upon
0	the
0	first
0	arrival
0	of
0	the
0	ships
0	upon
0	the
0	coast
0	,
0	wished
0	to
0	have
0	prohibited
0	all
0	commerce
0	with
0	the
0	women
0	of
0	the
0	island
0	;

0	but
0	he
0	soon
0	found
0	,
0	that
0	if
0	that
0	commerce
0	was
0	forbidden
0	,
0	all
0	other
0	trade
0	must
0	cease
0	of
0	course
0	,
0	for
0	not
0	a
0	pig
0	could
0	be
0	purchased
0	,
0	unless
0	a
0	girl
0	was
0	permitted
0	to
0	bring
0	it
0	to
0	market
0	.

0	There
0	are
0	who
0	have
0	blamed
PERSON-B	Capt.
PERSON-I	Cook
0	for
0	his
0	severity
0	to
0	the
0	Indians
0	;

0	but
0	it
0	was
0	not
0	to
0	the
0	Indians
0	alone
0	that
0	he
0	was
0	severe
0	in
0	his
0	discipline
0	.

0	He
0	never
0	suffered
0	any
0	fault
0	in
0	his
0	own
0	people
0	,
0	though
0	ever
0	so
0	trivial
0	,
0	to
0	escape
0	unpunished
0	.

0	If
0	they
0	were
0	charged
0	with
0	insulting
0	an
0	Indian
0	,
0	or
0	injuring
0	him
0	in
0	his
0	property
0	,
0	if
0	the
0	fact
0	was
0	proved
0	,
0	the
0	offender
0	was
0	surely
0	punished
0	in
0	sight
0	of
0	the
0	Indians
0	.

0	By
0	this
0	impartial
0	distribution
0	of
0	justice
0	,
0	the
0	Indians
0	themselves
0	conceived
0	so
0	high
0	an
0	idea
0	of
0	his
0	wisdom
0	,
0	and
0	his
0	power
0	too
0	,
0	that
0	they
0	paid
0	him
0	the
0	same
0	honours
0	as
0	they
0	did
0	their
0	Et-u-a
0	,
0	or
0	Good
0	Spirit
0	.

0	The
0	caulkers
0	,
0	who
0	have
0	already
0	been
0	mentioned
0	,
0	when

0	came
0	round
0	in
0	course
0	to
0	the
0	after-part
0	of
0	the
0	Resolution
0	,
0	found
0	that
0	,
0	besides
0	the
0	seams
0	that
0	wanted
0	closing
0	,
0	there
0	were
0	other
0	more
0	material
0	defects
0	.

0	The
0	rudder
0	's
0	eyes
0	were
0	almost
0	eaten
0	through
0	with
0	rust
0	,
0	and
0	the
0	bolts
0	ready
0	to
0	tumble
0	out
0	.

0	This
0	was
0	an
0	alarming
0	defect
0	;

0	and
0	all
0	other
0	business
0	was
0	suspended
0	till

0	Every

0	went

0	now
0	as
0	smoothly
0	as
0	could
0	be
0	wished
0	.

0	The
0	Chiefs
0	,
0	if
0	they
0	saw
0	any
0	of
0	their

0	people
0	misbehave

0	themselves
0	give

0	,
0	and
0	bring
0	them
0	to

0	;

0	they
0	were
0	so
0	very
0	obliging
0	,
0	that
0	,
0	seeing
0	us
0	in
0	want
0	of
0	wood
0	to
0	burn
0	,
0	they
0	made
0	an

0	On

0	,
0	being
0	the
0	fourth
0	day
0	after
0	our
0	arrival
0	,
0	several

0	large
0	canoes
0	were
0	seen
0	to
0	come
0	from
0	the

0	We

0	the
0	friends
0	with
0	whom
0	we
0	had
0	traded
0	on
0	the
0	other
0	side
0	of
0	the
0	island
0	;

0	but
0	on
0	their
0	nearer
0	approach
0	,
0	we
0	found
0	they
0	were
0	all
0	armed
0	and
0	clothed
0	in
0	the
0	military
0	uniform
0	,
0	after
0	their
0	country
0	manner
0	.

0	This
0	gave
0	us
0	cause
0	to
0	suspect
0	some
0	traiterous
0	design
0	,
0	but
0	our
0	fears
0	were
0	in
0	some
0	measure
0	dissipated
0	by
0	the
0	assurances
0	we
0	received
0	from
0	our
0	friends
0	on
0	board
0	,
0	that
0	they
0	were
0	some
0	of
0	the
0	warriors
0	that
0	had
0	accompanied
0	the
0	King
0	in
0	his
0	expedition
0	against
0	the
0	Eree
0	of
0	Maw-wee
0	,
0	and
0	that
0	they
0	were
0	now
0	returning
0	home
0	in
0	triumph
0	;

0	but
0	,
0	notwithstanding
0	this
0	assurance
0	,
0	it
0	was
0	thought
0	prudent
0	to
0	be
0	upon
0	our
0	guard
0	,
0	and
0	the
0	rather
0	as
0	the
0	women
0	who
0	were
0	on
0	board
0	,
0	told
0	us
0	,
0	that
0	their
0	people
0	designed
0	to
0	attack
0	us
0	,
0	and
0	to
0	mattee
0	,
0	that
0	is
0	,
0	to
0	kill
0	us
0	every
0	one
0	.

0	Next
0	day
0	,
0	before
0	nine
0	in
0	the
0	morning
0	,
0	more
0	than
0	a
0	thousand
0	Indians
0	surrounded
0	the
0	Discovery
0	,
0	insomuch
0	that
0	pressing
0	their
0	weight
0	chiefly
0	on
0	one
0	side
0	,
0	the
0	ship
0	was
0	in
0	danger
0	of
0	being
0	over-set
0	.

0	The
0	Captain
0	ordered
0	two
0	great
0	guns
0	to
0	be
0	fired
0	,
0	in
0	order
0	to
0	try
0	what
0	effect
0	that
0	would
0	have
0	in
0	dispersing
0	them
0	.

0	In
0	less
0	than
0	three
0	minutes
0	,
0	there
0	were
0	a
0	thousand
0	heads
0	to
0	be
0	seen
0	above
0	water
0	,
0	so
0	many
0	having
0	jumped
0	into
0	the
0	sea
0	,
0	frighted
0	on
0	the
0	sudden
0	report
0	of
0	the
0	guns
0	;

0	neither
0	did
0	a
0	single
0	canoe
0	come
0	near
0	us
0	all
0	the
0	next
0	day
0	.

0	Some
0	of
0	the
0	women
0	however
0	remained
0	on
0	board
0	,
0	who
0	never
0	could
0	be
0	prevailed
0	on
0	to
0	shew
0	themselves
0	upon
0	deck
0	in
0	the
0	day-time
0	;

0	but
0	whether
0	from
0	fear
0	of
0	their
0	own
0	people
0	,
0	or
0	of
0	the
0	great
0	guns
0	,
0	we
0	never
0	could
0	learn
0	.

0	As
0	all
0	trade
0	was
0	now
0	stopt
0	,
0	and
0	nothing
0	brought
0	on
0	board
0	for
0	our
0	subsistence
0	,
PERSON-B	Capt.
PERSON-I	Cook
0	went
0	on
0	shore
0	to
0	expostulate
0	with
0	the
0	Chiefs
0	,
0	and
0	by
0	some
0	trifling
0	presents
0	to
0	engage
0	them
0	to
0	trade
0	as
0	before
0	;

0	threatening
0	at
0	the
0	same
0	time
0	to
0	lay
0	their
0	towns
0	waste
0	,
0	if
0	they
0	refused
0	to
0	supply
0	the
0	ships
0	with
0	the
0	provisions
0	they
0	stood
0	in
0	need
0	of
0	.

0	His
0	remonstrances
0	had
0	the
0	desired
0	effect
0	,
0	and
0	next
0	day
0	we
0	purchased
0	not
0	less
0	than
0	60
0	large
0	hogs
0	,
0	with
0	great
0	quantities
0	of
0	fruits
0	and
0	vegetables
0	for
0	the
0	ships
0	use
0	.

0	In
0	a
0	few
0	days
0	after
0	this
0	,
0	the
0	old
0	King
0	Terreeoboo
0	was
0	seen
0	to
0	enter
0	the
0	harbour
0	,
0	on
0	his
0	return
0	from
0	Maw-wee
0	.

0	In
0	the
0	afternoon
0	he
0	visited
0	the
0	ship
0	in
0	a
0	private
0	manner
0	,
0	attended
0	only
0	by
0	one
0	canoe
0	,
0	in
0	which
0	were
0	his
0	wife
0	and
0	children
0	.

0	He
0	staid
0	on
0	board
0	till
0	near
0	ten
0	at
0	night
0	,
0	when
0	he
0	returned
0	to
0	the
0	village
0	Kowrowa
0	.

0	The
0	next
0	day
0	about
0	noon
0	,
0	the
0	King
0	,
0	in
0	a
0	large
0	canoe
0	,
0	attended
0	by
0	two
0	others
0	,
0	set
0	out
0	from
0	the
0	village
0	,
0	and
0	paddled
0	towards
0	the
0	ships
0	,
0	in
0	great
0	state
0	.

0	Their
0	appearance
0	was
0	grand
0	and
0	magnificent
0	.

0	In
0	the
0	first
0	canoe
0	was
0	Terreeoboo
0	,
0	and
0	his
0	Chiefs
0	,
0	dressed
0	in
0	their
0	feathered
0	cloaks
0	and
0	helmets
0	,
0	and
0	armed
0	with
0	long
0	spears
0	and
0	daggers
0	.

0	In
0	the
0	second
0	,
0	came
0	the
0	venerable
0	Kaoo
0	,
0	the
0	Chief
0	of
0	the
0	Priests
0	,
0	and
0	his
0	brethren
0	,
0	with
0	their
0	idols
0	displayed
0	on
0	red
0	cloth
0	.

0	These
0	idols
0	were
0	busts
0	of
0	a
0	gigantic
0	size
0	,
0	made
0	of
0	wicker-work
0	,
0	and
0	curiously
0	covered
0	with
0	small
0	feathers
0	of
0	various

0	,
0	wrought
0	in
0	the
0	same
0	manner
0	with
0	their
0	cloaks
0	.

0	Their
0	eyes
0	were
0	made
0	of
0	large
0	pearl
0	oysters
0	,
0	with
0	a
0	black
0	nut
0	fixed
0	in
0	the
0	centre
0	;

0	their
0	mouths
0	were
0	set
0	with
0	a
0	Page
0	290
0	double
0	row
0	of
0	the

0	of
0	dogs
0	;

0	and
0	together
0	,
0	with
0	the
0	rest
0	of
0	their
0	features
0	,
0	were
0	strangely
0	distorted
0	.

0	The
0	third
0	canoe
0	was
0	filled
0	with
0	hogs
0	,
0	and
0	various
0	sorts
0	of
0	vegetables
0	.

0	As
0	they
0	went
0	along
0	,
0	the
0	Priests
0	,
0	in
0	the
0	centre
0	canoe
0	,
0	sung
0	their
0	hymns
0	with
0	great
0	solemnity
0	;

0	and
0	after
0	paddling
0	round
0	the
0	ships
0	,
0	instead
0	of
0	going
0	on
0	board
0	as
0	was
0	expected
0	,
0	they
0	made
0	towards
0	the
0	shore
0	,
0	at
0	the
0	beach
0	where
0	our
0	men
0	were
0	stationed
0	.

0	On
0	their
0	approach
0	,
0	the
0	guard
0	was
0	instantly
0	ordered
0	out
0	to
0	receive
0	the
0	King
0	;

0	and
PERSON-B	Capt.
PERSON-I	Cook
0	,
0	perceiving
0	he
0	was
0	going
0	on
0	shore
0	,
0	followed
0	him
0	,
0	and
0	arrived
0	nearly
0	at
0	the
0	same
0	time
0	.

0	They
0	were
0	conducted
0	into
0	the
0	tent
0	,
0	where
0	they
0	had
0	scarce
0	been
0	seated
0	,
0	when
0	the
0	King
0	rose
0	up
0	,
0	and
0	,
0	in
0	a
0	very
0	graceful
0	manner
0	,
0	threw
0	over
0	the
0	Captain
0	's
0	shoulders
0	,
0	the
0	cloak
0	he
0	himself
0	wore
0	,
0	put
0	a
0	feathered
0	helmet
0	upon
0	his
0	head
0	,
0	and
0	a
0	curious
0	fan
0	in
0	his
0	hand
0	.

0	He
0	also
0	spread
0	at
0	his
0	feet
0	five
0	or
0	six
0	other
0	cloaks
0	,
0	all
0	exceedingly
0	beautiful
0	,
0	and
0	of
0	great
0	value
0	.

0	His
0	attendants
0	then
0	brought
0	four
0	very
0	large
0	hogs
0	,
0	with
0	sugar-canes
0	,
0	cocoa-nuts
0	,
0	and

0	fruit
0	.

0	This
0	part
0	of
0	the
0	ceremony
0	over
0	,
0	they
0	all
0	made
0	a
0	circle
0	round
0	with
0	their
0	images
0	in
0	procession
0	,
0	till
0	they
0	arrived
0	at
0	their
0	Morai
0	,
0	where
0	they
0	placed
0	their
0	deities
0	,
0	and
0	deposited
0	their
0	arms
0	.

0	Next
0	day
0	both
0	Captains
0	,
0	accompanied
0	with
0	several
0	of
0	their

0	,
0	went
0	to
0	pay
0	the
0	King
0	a
0	visit
0	on
0	shore
0	.

0	They
0	were
0	very
0	respectfully
0	received
0	,
0	and
0	having
0	dined
0	after
0	the
0	Indian
0	manner
0	,
0	the
0	King
0	rose
0	,
0	and
0	clothing
PERSON-B	Capt.
PERSON-I	Cook
0	with
0	a
0	mantle
0	,
0	such
0	as
0	is
0	worn
0	by
0	the
0	great
0	Oreno
0	in
0	grand
0	procession
0	,
0	he
0	was
0	conducted
0	to
0	the
0	morai
0	,
0	or
0	place
0	of
0	worship
0	,
0	where
0	a
0	garland
0	of
0	green
0	plantain
0	leaves
0	was
0	put
0	upon
0	his
0	head
0	,
0	and
0	he
0	was
0	seated
0	on
0	a
0	kind
0	of
0	throne
0	,
0	and
0	had
0	the
0	honour
0	of
0	exchanging
0	names
0	with
0	the
0	King
0	,
0	the
0	strongest
0	pledge
0	of
0	friendship
0	these
0	islanders
0	can
0	confer
0	.

0	He
0	was
0	now
0	addressed
0	in
0	a
0	long
0	oration
0	by
0	a
0	priest
0	clothed
0	in
0	a
0	vestment
0	of
0	party-coloured
0	cloth
0	,
0	who
0	concluded
0	the
0	solemnity
0	with
0	a
0	choral
0	hymn
0	,
0	in
0	which
0	he
0	was
0	joined
0	by
0	all
0	the
0	priests
0	present
0	;

0	who
0	had
0	no
0	sooner
0	finished
0	their
0	song
0	than
0	they
0	all
0	fell
0	at
0	his
0	feet
0	,
0	the
0	King
0	acquainting
0	him
0	,
0	that
0	this
0	was
0	now
0	his
0	building
0	,
0	and
0	that
0	he
0	was
0	from
0	henceforth
0	their
0	Orono
0	.

0	From
0	this
0	time
0	an
PERSON-B	Indian
PERSON-I	Priest
0	was
0	,
0	by
PERSON-B	the
PERSON-I	King
0	's
0	order
0	,
0	placed
0	at
0	the
0	head
0	of
0	his
0	pinnace
0	,
0	at
0	whose
0	approach
0	the
0	Indians
0	in
0	their
0	canoes
0	,
0	as
0	he
0	passed
0	them
0	,
0	prostrated
0	themselves
0	till
0	he
0	was
0	out
0	of
0	sight
0	;

0	and
0	this
0	they
0	did
0	when
0	the
0	Captain
0	was
0	alone
0	:
0	but
0	the
0	Priests
0	had
0	orders
0	from
0	the
0	King
0	,
0	whenever
0	the
0	Captain
0	came
0	ashore
0	in
0	his
0	pinnace
0	,
0	to
0	attend
0	him
0	,
0	and

0	him
0	to

0	,
0	which
0	the
0	sailors
0	now
0	called
PERSON-B	Cook
0	's
0	Altar
0	.

0	When
0	all
0	these
0	solemnities
0	were
0	over
0	,
0	we
0	were
0	not
0	a
0	little
0	astonished
0	to
0	find
0	in
0	this
0	King
0	,
0	the
0	same
0	infirm
0	,
0	emaciated
0	,
0	old
0	man
0	,
0	that
0	came
0	on
0	board
PERSON-B	Capt.
PERSON-I	Cook
0	when
0	off
0	the
0	island
0	of
0	Ma-wee
0	;

0	and
0	it
0	was
0	soon
0	discovered
0	,
0	that
0	he
0	was
0	then
0	accompanied
0	with
0	the
0	same
0	persons
0	,
0	viz.
0	his
0	two
0	younger
0	sons
0	,
0	one
0	sixteen
0	,
0	the
0	other
0	twelve
0	,
0	with
0	his
0	nephew
0	Maiha-Macha
0	,
0	a
0	man
0	of
0	a
0	most
0	savage
0	countenance
0	.

0	&#91;
0	When
0	we
0	first
0	approached
0	the
0	coast
0	of
0	this
0	island
0	of
PLACE-B	O
PLACE-I	why
PLACE-I	hee
0	,
0	we
0	were
0	astonished
0	at
0	the
0	sight
0	of
0	a
0	mountain
0	of
0	a
0	stupendous
0	height
0	,
0	whose
0	head
0	was
0	covered
0	with
0	snow
0	.

0	This
0	was
0	so
0	rare
0	a
0	sight
0	in
0	an
0	island
0	between
0	the
0	tropics
0	,
0	that
0	several
0	of
0	the
0	officers
0	and
0	gentlemen
0	from
0	both
0	ships
0	were
0	desirous
0	of
0	taking
0	a
0	nearer
0	view
0	of
0	it
0	;

0	and
0	for
0	that
0	purpose
0	they
0	requested
PERSON-B	the
PERSON-I	King
0	's
0	permission

PERSON-B	Mr.
PERSON-I	Nelson
0	,
0	our
0	botanist
0	,
0	and
0	four
0	other
0	gentlemen
0	set
0	out
0	in
0	the
0	morning
0	on
0	this
0	expedition
0	,
0	which
0	they
0	afterwards
0	found
0	attended
0	with
0	no
0	small
0	fatigue
0	,
0	and
0	not
0	a
0	little
0	danger
0	;

0	for
0	after
0	travelling
0	two
0	days
0	and
0	two
0	nights
0	,
0	and
0	experiencing
0	the
0	greatest
0	fatigue
0	and
0	hardships
0	;

0	no
0	water
0	,
0	no
0	paths
0	to
0	direct
0	their
0	way
0	;

0	no
0	inhabitants
0	for
0	many
0	miles
0	,
0	and
0	the
0	cold
0	excessive
0	as
0	they
0	approached
0	the
0	mountain
0	,
0	which
0	seemed
0	covered
0	with
0	snow
0	,
0	they
0	were
0	glad
0	to
0	get
0	back
0	without
0	any
0	accident
0	.

0	In
0	the
0	course
0	of
0	their
0	journey
0	,
0	they
0	were
0	directed
0	to
0	the
0	cottage
0	of
0	an
0	old
0	hermit
0	,
0	who
0	,
0	they
0	said
0	,
0	had
0	formerly
0	been
0	a
0	great
0	warrior
0	;

0	but
0	who
0	,
0	for
0	several
0	years
0	past
0	,
0	had
0	retired
0	to
0	this
0	sequestered
0	spot
0	.

0	He
0	received
0	them
0	without
0	any
0	kind
0	of
0	emotion
0	,
0	but
0	would
0	accept
0	of
0	nothing
0	that
0	they
0	offered
0	him
0	.

0	He
0	appeared
0	by
0	far
0	the
0	oldest
0	man
0	they
0	had
0	seen
0	on
0	the
0	island
0	.

0	On
0	the
0	29th
0	they
0	returned
0	to
0	the
0	ships
0	,
0	and
0	the
0	only
0	advantage
0	that
0	accrued
0	from
0	their
0	journey
0	,
0	was
0	,
0	a
0	curious
0	assortment
0	of
0	indigenous
0	plants
0	and
0	some
0	natural
0	curiosities
0	,
0	collected
0	by
PERSON-B	Mr.
PERSON-I	Nelson
0	.

0	During
0	their
0	absence
0	every
0	thing
0	remained
0	quiet
0	at
0	the
0	tents
0	,
0	and
0	the
0	Indians
0	supplied
0	the
0	ships
0	with
0	such
0	quantities
0	of
0	provisions
0	of
0	all
0	kinds
0	,
0	that
0	orders
0	were
0	given
0	to
0	purchase
0	no
0	more
0	hogs
0	in
0	one
0	day
0	than
0	could
0	be
0	killed
0	,
0	salted
0	,
0	and
0	stowed
0	away
0	the
0	next
0	day
0	.

0	This
0	order
0	was
0	in
0	consequence
0	of
0	a
0	former
0	order
0	,
0	to
0	purchase
0	all
0	that
0	could
0	be
0	procured
0	for
0	sea-stock
0	;

0	by
0	which
0	so
0	many
0	were
0	brought
0	on
0	board
0	,
0	that
0	several
0	of
0	them
0	died
0	before
0	they
0	could
0	be
0	properly
0	disposed
0	of
0	.

0	It
0	had
0	been
0	generally
0	thought
0	impracticable
0	to
0	cure
0	the
0	flesh
0	of
0	these
0	animals
0	in
0	the
0	tropical
0	climates
0	;

0	and
0	it
0	is
0	believed
0	,
0	that
0	few
0	trials
0	had
0	ever
0	/
0	&gt;
0	been
0	made
0	before
0	those
0	of
PERSON-B	Capt.
PERSON-I	Cook
0	.

0	In
0	his
0	first
0	voyage
0	in
0	1774
0	,
0	he
0	first
0	made
0	the
0	attempt
0	,
0	but
0	not
0	very
0	successfully
0	.

0	But
0	it
0	was
0	now
0	become
0	absolutely
0	necessary
0	,
0	either
0	to
0	perfect
0	the
0	discovery
0	,
0	or
0	relinquish
0	the
0	voyage
0	.

0	The
0	method
0	we
0	took
0	was
0	always
0	to
0	slaughter
0	them
0	in
0	the
0	afternoon
0	,
0	and
0	as
0	soon
0	as
0	the
0	hair
0	was
0	scalded
0	off
0	,
0	and
0	the
0	entrails
0	removed
0	,
0	the
0	carcass
0	was
0	divided
0	into
0	pieces
0	,
0	from
0	four
0	to
0	eight
0	pounds
0	each
0	,
0	and
0	the
0	bones
0	of
0	the
0	chine
0	and
0	legs
0	taken
0	out
0	,
0	and
0	,
0	in
0	the
0	large
0	sort
0	,
0	the
0	ribs
0	also
0	.

0	Every
0	piece
0	being
0	then
0	carefully
0	wiped
0	and
0	examined
0	,
0	that
0	no
0	bruise
0	might
0	escape
0	,
0	and
0	all
0	the
0	veins
0	cleared
0	out
0	,
0	that
0	no
0	coagulated
0	blood
0	might
0	remain
0	,
0	they
0	were
0	then
0	handed
0	to
0	the
0	salters
0	while
0	the
0	flesh
0	was
0	still
0	warm
0	.

0	After
0	they
0	had
0	been
0	well
0	rubbed
0	with
0	salt
0	,
0	they
0	were
0	then
0	placed
0	in
0	a
0	heap
0	on
0	a
0	stage
0	,
0	raised
0	in
0	the
0	open
0	air
0	,
0	covered
0	with
0	planks
0	,
0	and
0	pressed
0	with
0	the
0	heaviest
0	weights
0	we
0	could
0	lay
0	on
0	them
0	.

0	In
0	this
0	situation
0	they
0	lay
0	till
0	the
0	next
0	evening
0	,
0	when
0	they
0	were
0	again
0	well
0	wiped
0	and
0	examined
0	,
0	and
0	the
0	suspicious
0	parts
0	taken
0	away
0	.

0	They
0	were
0	then
0	put
0	into
0	a
0	tub
0	of
0	strong
0	pickle
0	,
0	where
0	they
0	were
0	always
0	looked
0	over
0	once
0	or
0	twice
0	a
0	day
0	,
0	and
0	if
0	any
0	piece
0	had
0	not
0	taken
0	salt
0	,
0	which
0	was
0	readily
0	discovered
0	by
0	the
0	smell
0	,
0	they
0	were
0	immediately
0	taken
0	out
0	,
0	re-examined
0	,
0	and
0	the
PLACE-B	sound
0	pieces
0	put
0	to
0	fresh
0	pickle
0	,
0	and
0	the
0	other
0	either
0	used
0	immediately
0	,
0	or
0	thrown
0	away
0	.

0	This
0	,
0	however
0	,
0	seldom
0	happened
0	.

0	After
0	six
0	days
0	,
0	they
0	were
0	taken
0	out
0	,
0	examined
0	for
0	the
0	last
0	time
0	,
0	and
0	being
0	again
0	lightly
0	pressed
0	,
0	they
0	were
0	packed
0	in
0	barrels
0	with
0	a
0	thin
0	layer
0	of
0	salt
0	between
0	them
0	.

0	Some
0	of
0	this
0	pork
0	was
0	brought
0	to
PLACE-B	England
0	,
0	perfectly
0	sweet
0	and
0	good
0	.

0	On
0	the
0	1st
0	of
0	February
0	,
0	1779
0	,
0	William
0	Watman
0	,
0	gunner
0	's
0	mate
0	,
0	died
0	.

0	His
0	body
0	in
0	the
0	afternoon
0	was
0	carried
0	on
0	shore
0	in
0	the
0	pinnace
0	,
0	and
0	buried
0	,
0	according
0	to
0	his
0	own
0	desire
0	,
0	in
0	the
0	Morai
0	belonging
0	to
0	the
0	King
0	.

0	The
0	Indians
0	who
0	dug
0	his
0	grave
0	about
0	four
0	feet
0	deep
0	,
0	covered
0	the
0	bottom
0	of
0	it
0	with
0	green
0	leaves
0	;

0	and
0	when
0	the
0	corpse
0	was
0	deposited
0	in
0	the
0	earth
0	,
0	the
0	Chiefs
0	who
0	attended
0	the
0	funeral
0	,
0	put
0	a
0	barbecued
0	hog
0	at
0	the
0	head
0	,
0	and
0	another
0	at
0	the

0	,
0	with
0	a
0	quantity
0	of
0	bread-fruit
0	,
0	plantains
0	and
0	bananas
0	.

0	More
0	was
0	going
0	to
0	be
0	added
0	,
0	when
PERSON-B	Capt.
PERSON-I	Cook
0	ordered
0	the
0	grave
0	to
0	be
0	covered
0	up
0	,
0	and
0	a
0	post
0	erected
0	to
0	the
0	memory
0	of
0	the
0	deceased
0	,
0	inscribed
0	with

0	,
0	the
0	date
0	of
0	the
0	year
0	,
0	day
0	of
0	his
0	death
0	,
0	and
0	the
0	nation
0	to
0	which
0	he
0	belonged
0	.

0	From
0	this
0	circumstance
0	,
PERSON-B	Capt.
PERSON-I	Cook
0	gave
0	this
0	port
0	the
0	name
0	of
0	Watman
0	's
0	Harbour
0	.

0	The
0	next
0	day
0	the
0	Indians
0	rolled
0	large
0	stones
0	over
0	his
0	grave
0	,
0	and
0	brought
0	two

0	bananas
0	,
0	cocoa-nuts
0	,

0	,
0	upon
0	a
0	stage
0	erected
0	for
0	that
0	purpose
0	.

0	We
0	were
0	now
0	preparing
0	to
0	depart
0	,
0	when
0	our
0	Captain
0	was
0	presented
0	by
0	the
0	King
0	with
0	twelve
0	large
0	hogs

0	;

0	and
0	the
0	same
0	present
0	was
0	made
0	to
PERSON-B	Capt.
PERSON-I	Cook
0	.

0	This
0	day
0	,
0	Feb.
0	2
0	,
0	the
0	King
0	came
0	on
0	board
0	,
0	attended
0	with
0	twenty
0	of
0	his
0	Chiefs
0	,
0	and
0	gave
0	the
0	Captains
0	of
0	both
0	ships
0	,
0	with
0	their
0	officers
0	,
0	an
0	invitation
0	to
0	an
0	heiva
0	,
0	in
0	which
0	many
0	of
0	the
0	principal
0	Chiefs
0	were
0	to
0	be
0	performers
0	.

PERSON-B	Capt.
PERSON-I	Clerke
0	excused
0	himself
0	from
0	ill
0	health
0	;

0	but
PERSON-B	Capt.
PERSON-I	Cook
0	and
0	the
0	other
0	Gentlemen
0	promised
0	to
0	attend
0	.

0	The
0	same
0	day
0	the
0	King
0	and
0	his
0	Chiefs
0	dined
0	on
0	board
0	the
0	Resolution
0	,
0	and
0	were
0	entertained
0	with
0	music
0	,
0	the
0	whole
0	band
0	having
0	orders
0	to
0	play
0	all
0	the
0	while
0	they
0	sat
0	at
0	dinner
0	.

0	They
0	were
0	highly
0	delighted
0	with
0	the
0	music
0	,
0	and
0	would
0	not
0	suffer
0	the
0	performers
0	to
0	rest
0	a
0	moment
0	.

0	About
0	four
0	in
0	the
0	afternoon
0	,
0	the
0	pinnaces
0	from
0	both
0	ships
0	were
0	ordered
0	to
0	be
0	in
0	readiness
0	to
0	take
0	the
0	company
0	ashore
0	,
0	with
0	their
0	pendants
0	and
0	colours
0	displayed
0	,
0	to
0	do
0	honour
0	to
0	a
0	king
0	and
0	people
0	,
0	by
0	whom
0	we
0	had
0	been
0	so
0	hospitably
0	entertained
0	.

0	More
0	than
0	200
0	canoes
0	attended
0	us
0	to
0	shore
0	,
0	where
0	a
0	number
0	of
0	Chiefs
0	were
0	ready
0	to
0	receive
0	us
0	,
0	who
0	ail
0	observed
0	a
0	profound
0	silence
0	at
0	our
0	landing
0	,
0	and
0	conducted
0	us
0	to
0	the
0	place
0	appointed
0	for
0	the
0	entertainment
0	.

0	But
0	we
0	were
0	much
0	disappointed
0	by
0	the
0	performers
0	,
0	who
0	were
0	far
0	inferior
0	to
0	those
0	of
0	the
0	Southern
0	islands
0	.

0	The
0	only
0	part
0	of
0	the
0	performance
0	that
0	was
0	tolerable
0	,
0	was
0	their
0	singing
0	,
0	with
0	which
0	the
0	heiva
0	or
0	play
0	concluded
0	;

0	the
0	young
0	princesses
0	,
0	the
0	chiefs
0	,
0	and
0	even
0	the
0	king
0	himself
0	joining
0	in
0	the
0	chorus
0	.

0	The
0	play
0	being
0	ended
0	,
PERSON-B	Capt.
PERSON-I	Cook
0	acquainted
0	the
0	King
0	that
0	,
0	with
0	his
0	permission
0	,
0	he
0	would
0	exhibit
0	some
0	fire-works
0	,
0	that
0	,
0	if
0	they
0	did
0	not
0	frighten
0	,
0	would
0	very
0	much
0	astonish
0	his
0	people
0	.

0	The
0	King
0	very
0	readily
0	gave
0	his
0	consent
0	;

0	and
0	the
0	engineer
0	was
0	ordered
0	to
0	begin
0	his
0	exhibition
0	as
0	soon
0	as
0	it
0	was
0	dark
0	.

0	On
0	the
0	rising
0	of
0	the
0	first
0	sky-rocket
0	,
0	the
0	Indians
0	fled
0	precipitately
0	,
0	and
0	hid
0	themselves
0	in
0	the
0	houses
0	,
0	or
0	wherever
0	they
0	could
0	find
0	any
0	shelter
0	;

0	at
0	first
0	there
0	were
0	some
0	thousand
0	spectators
0	;

0	but
0	in
0	less
0	than
0	ten
0	minutes
0	there
0	were
0	not
0	fifty
0	to
0	be
0	seen
0	,
0	the
0	King
0	and
0	his
0	attendants
0	excepted
0	,
0	whom
0	the
0	Captain
0	and
0	the
0	gentlemen
0	with
0	the
0	greatest
0	difficulty
0	persuaded
0	to
0	stay
0	.

0	When
0	the
0	second
0	rose
0	up
0	in
0	the
0	air
0	,
0	lamentations
0	were
0	heard
0	from
0	every
0	quarter
0	;

0	and
0	when
0	the
0	water-rockets
0	were
0	played
0	off
0	,
0	the
0	King
0	and
0	his
0	Chiefs
0	were
0	hardly
0	to
0	be
0	restrained
0	.

0	Other
0	fire-works
0	it
0	was
0	found
0	dangerous
0	to
0	exhibit
0	,
0	as
0	these
0	had
0	already
0	struck
0	the
0	spectators
0	,
0	the
0	King
0	as
0	well
0	as
0	his
0	people
0	,
0	with
0	a
0	general
0	panic
0	.

0	We
0	therefore
0	took
0	leave
0	of
0	the
0	King
0	and
0	Royal
0	family
0	,
0	and
0	returned
0	on
0	board
0	our
0	respective
0	ships
0	.

0	The
0	King
0	having
0	been
0	made
0	to
0	understand
0	that
0	we
0	should
0	sail
0	the
0	first
0	fair
0	wind
0	,
0	came
0	next
0	morning
0	to
0	visit
0	the
0	Captains
0	of
0	both
0	ships
0	,
0	who
0	were
0	now
0	preparing
0	to
0	sail
0	.

0	This
0	being
0	publicly
0	known
0	,
0	the
0	Indians
0	in
0	general
0	expressed
0	their
0	concern
0	,
0	but
0	particularly
0	the
0	young
0	women
0	,
0	whose
0	lamentations
0	were
0	heard
0	from
0	every
0	quarter
0	.

0	In
0	the
0	evening
0	of
0	the
0	4th
0	of
0	February
0	,
0	all
0	hands
0	were
0	mustered
0	,
0	and
0	none
0	were
0	missing
0	.

0	In
0	the
0	morning
0	of
0	the
0	5th
0	,
0	we
0	cleared
0	the
0	harbour
0	,
0	shaping
0	our
0	course
0	for
0	Maw-wee
0	,
0	as
0	we
0	had
0	been
0	informed
0	by
0	the
0	King
0	,
0	that
0	in
0	that
0	island
0	there
0	was
0	a
0	fine
0	harbour
0	and
0	excellent
0	water
0	.

0	We
0	had
0	not
0	been
0	long
0	under
0	sail
0	,
0	when
0	the
0	King
0	,
0	who
0	had
0	omitted
0	to
0	take
0	his
0	leave
0	of
0	our
0	Captain
0	in
0	the
0	morning
0	,
0	as
0	not
0	suspecting
0	our
0	departure
0	so
0	sudden
0	,
0	came
0	after
0	the
0	ships
0	,
0	accompanied
0	by
0	the
0	young
0	prince
0	,
0	his
0	son
0	,
0	in
0	a
0	sailing
0	canoe
0	,
0	bringing
0	with
0	them
0	ten
0	large
0	hogs
0	,
0	a
0	great
0	number
0	of
0	fowls
0	,
0	and
0	a
0	small
0	turtle
0	(
0	a
0	great
0	rarity
0	)
0	with
0	bread-fruit
0	in
0	abundance
0	.

0	They
0	also
0	brought
0	with
0	them
0	great
0	quantities
0	of
0	cocoa-nuts
0	,
0	plantains
0	,
0	and
0	sugar-canes
0	.

0	Besides
0	other
0	persons
0	of
0	condition
0	who
0	acompanied
0	the
0	King
0	,
0	there
0	was
0	an
0	old
0	priest
0	,
0	Kaoa
0	,
0	who
0	had
0	always
0	shewn
0	a
0	particular
0	attachment
0	to
PERSON-B	Capt.
PERSON-I	Clerke
0	,
0	and
0	who
0	had
0	not
0	been
0	unrewarded
0	for
0	his
0	civility
0	.

0	It
0	being
0	rather
0	late
0	when
0	they
0	reached
0	the
0	ships
0	,
0	they
0	staid
0	on
0	board
0	but
0	a
0	few
0	hours
0	,
0	and
0	then
0	all
0	departed
0	except
0	the
0	old
0	priest
0	and
0	some
0	girls
0	,
0	who
0	by
0	the
0	King
0	's
0	permission
0	were
0	suffered
0	to
0	remain
0	on
0	board
0	till
0	they
0	should
0	arrive
0	at
0	some
0	of
0	the
0	neighbouring
0	isles
0	.

0	We
0	were
0	now
0	steering
0	with
0	a
0	fine
0	breeze
0	,
0	but
0	just
0	at
0	the
0	close
0	of
0	the
0	evening
0	,
0	to
0	our
0	great
0	mortification
0	,
0	the
0	wind
0	died
0	away
0	,
0	and
0	a
0	great
0	swell
0	succeeding
0	,
0	with
0	a
0	strong
0	current
0	setting
0	right
0	in
0	for
0	the
0	shore
0	,
0	we
0	were
0	in
0	the
0	utmost
0	danger
0	of
0	being
0	driven
0	upon
0	the
0	rocks
0	.

0	In
0	the
0	height
0	of
0	our
0	distress
0	and
0	trouble
0	,
0	the
0	old
0	priest
0	,
0	who
0	had
0	been
0	suffered
0	to
0	sleep
0	in
0	the
0	great
0	cabin
0	,
0	leapt
0	overboard
0	unseen
0	,
0	with
0	a
0	piece
0	of
0	silk
0	,
0	the
0	Captain
0	's
0	property
0	,
0	and
0	swam
0	to
0	shore
0	.

0	The
0	next
0	day
0	,
0	seeing
0	a
0	large
0	canoe
0	between
0	us
0	and
0	the
0	shore
0	,
0	we
0	hove-to
0	for
0	her
0	coming
0	up
0	,
0	and
0	to
0	our
0	great
0	surprize
0	perceived
0	the
0	old
0	King
0	,
0	accompanied
0	by
0	several
0	of
0	his
0	Chiefs
0	,
0	having
0	in
0	their
0	vessel
0	the
0	priest
0	who
0	had
0	stolen
0	the
0	silk
0	,
0	whom
0	the
0	King
0	delivered
0	to
0	the
0	Captain
0	,
0	at
0	the
0	same
0	time
0	requesting
0	that
0	his
0	fault
0	might
0	be
0	forgiven
0	.

0	The
0	King
0	being
0	told
0	that
0	his
0	request
0	was
0	granted
0	,
0	unbound
0	him
0	,
0	and
0	set
0	him
0	at
0	liberty
0	;

0	telling
0	the
0	Captain
0	that
0	,
0	seeing
0	him
0	with
0	the
0	silk
0	,
0	he
0	judged
0	it
0	was
0	none
0	of
0	his
0	own
0	,
0	and
0	therefore
0	ordered
0	him
0	to
0	be
0	apprehended
0	;

0	and
0	had
0	taken
0	this
0	method
0	of
0	exposing
0	him
0	for
0	injuring
0	his
0	friend
0	.

0	This
0	singular
0	instance
0	of
0	Indian
0	generosity
0	and
0	justice
0	,
0	ought
0	not
0	to
0	be
0	forgotten
0	.

0	It
0	appears
0	,
0	however
0	,
0	that
0	this
0	old
0	priest
0	,
0	who
0	had
0	changed
0	names
0	,
0	and
0	was
0	proud
0	of
0	being
0	called
0	Bretanne
0	,
0	had
0	slipt
0	away
0	from
PERSON-B	Mr.
PERSON-I	Bligh
0	,
0	master
0	of
0	the
0	Resolution
0	,
0	to
0	whom
0	he
0	had
0	pretended
0	to
0	discover
0	a
0	much
0	more
0	commodious
0	harbour
0	,
0	than
0	that
0	of
0	Kakooa
0	,
0	which
0	they
0	had
0	just
0	left
0	.

0	As
0	soon
0	as
0	they
0	had
0	delivered
0	the
0	silk
0	,
0	which
0	the
0	Captain
0	would
0	have
0	had
0	the
0	King
0	to
0	accept
0	,
0	they
0	departed
0	,
0	and
0	had
0	scarce
0	reached
0	the
0	shore
0	,
0	when
0	a
0	heavy
0	gale
0	came
0	on
0	,
0	with
0	thunder
0	,
0	lightning
0	,
0	and
0	hard
0	rain
0	.

0	We
0	wore
0	ship
0	,
0	and
0	continued
0	working
0	off
0	the
0	land
0	all
0	night
0	,
0	and
0	soon
0	lost
0	sight
0	of
0	the
0	Resolution
0	,
0	who
0	,
0	as
0	well
0	as
0	the
0	Discovery
0	,
0	continued
0	bea
0	•
0	ing
0	about
0	the
0	island
0	seven
0	days
0	successively
0	,
0	in
0	n
0	=
0	"
0	298
0	"
0	/
0	&gt;
0	dread
0	every
0	moment
0	of
0	being
0	wrecked
0	upon
0	the
0	coast
0	.

0	On
0	the
0	fourth
0	day
0	,
0	after
0	we
0	had
0	lost
0	sight
0	of
0	the
0	Resolution
0	,
0	the
0	storm
0	being
0	a
0	little
0	abated
0	,
0	we
0	observed
0	her
0	under
0	a
0	high
0	part
0	of
0	the
0	island
0	,
0	lying
0	with
0	her
0	fore-top-gallant-mast
0	down
0	,
0	her
0	fore-top-sail-yard
0	upon
0	the
0	cap
0	,
0	and
0	the
0	sail
0	furled
0	,
0	which
0	gave
0	us
0	reason
0	to
0	suppose
0	that
0	some
0	accident
0	had
0	befallen
0	her
0	;

0	and
0	as
0	we
0	expected
0	,
0	so
0	we
0	found
0	it
0	.

0	We
0	stood
0	down
0	for
0	her
0	with
0	a
0	heavy
0	gale
0	;

0	but
0	it
0	was
0	not
0	till
0	next
0	day
0	that
0	we
0	could
0	come
0	to
0	speak
0	with
0	her
0	.

PERSON-B	Capt.
PERSON-I	Cook
0	himself
0	being
0	upon
0	deck
0	when
0	we
0	came
0	up
0	,
0	informed
0	us
0	that
0	he
0	had
0	sprung
0	his
0	fore-mast
0	in
0	two
0	different
0	places
0	;

0	that
0	the
0	ship
0	was
0	leaky
0	,
0	and
0	that
0	it
0	was
0	with
0	the
0	greatest
0	difficulty
0	they
0	kept
0	her
0	above
0	water
0	.

0	He
0	further
0	said
0	,
0	that
0	on
0	the
0	7th
0	in
0	the
0	morning
0	they
0	discovered
0	the
0	leak
0	;

0	that
0	at
0	that
0	time
0	they
0	made
0	thirty
0	inches
0	of
0	water
0	in
0	three
0	hours
0	;

0	and
0	that
0	ever
0	since
0	all
0	hands
0	had
0	been
0	constantly
0	employed
0	night
0	and
0	day
0	in
0	baling
0	and
0	pumping
0	;

0	we
0	likewise
0	understood
0	,
0	that
0	they
0	had
0	split
0	their
0	main-top-sail
0	,
0	and
0	that
0	they
0	were
0	now
0	bound
0	to
0	our
0	late
0	harbour
0	to
0	repair
0	their
0	damage
0	.

0	We
0	pursued
0	the
0	same
0	course
0	;

0	but
0	it
0	was
0	not
0	till
0	the
0	11th
0	,
0	when
0	we
0	opened
0	on
0	the
0	bay
0	in
0	which
0	lay
0	our
0	port
0	.

0	We
0	were
0	very
0	soon
0	surrounded
0	with
0	our
0	old
0	friends
0	,
0	who
0	brought
0	us
0	hogs
0	,
0	bread-fruit
0	,
0	plantains
0	,
0	bananoes
0	,
0	and
0	cocoa-nuts
0	,
0	which
0	they
0	threw
0	on
0	board
0	,
0	without
0	waiting
0	for
0	any
0	recompense
0	.

0	We
0	were
0	likewise
0	visited
0	by
0	the
0	old
0	King
0	,
0	the
0	Prince
0	,
0	and
0	many
0	of
0	the
0	Chiefs
0	,
0	who
0	came
0	to
0	welcome
0	us
0	,
0	and
0	who
0	were
0	seemingly
0	glad
0	of
0	our
0	return
0	.

0	About
0	ten
0	in
0	the
0	morning
0	,
0	both
0	ships
0	moored
0	near
0	their
0	old
0	birth
0	,
0	and
0	presently
0	all
0	hands
0	were
0	set
0	to
0	work
0	to
0	strip
0	the
0	mast
0	,
0	and
0	to
0	carry
0	it
0	on
0	shore
0	to
0	be
0	repaired
0	.

0	The
0	next
0	day
0	the
0	King
0	came
0	again
0	on
0	board
0	,
0	and
0	mutual
0	presents
0	and
0	mutual
0	civilities
0	were
0	continued
0	as
0	usual
0	:
0	but
0	about
0	five
0	in
0	the
0	afternoon
0	,
0	there
0	came
0	along-side
0	a
0	large
0	canoe
0	,
0	with
0	about
0	60
0	of
0	their
0	fighting
0	men
0	,
0	all
0	armed
0	,
0	with
0	little
0	or
0	no
0	provisions
0	on
0	board
0	,
0	and
0	who
0	seemed
0	to
0	have
0	no
0	good
0	design
0	.

0	Our
0	Captain
0	observing
0	their
0	motions
0	,
0	ordered
0	the
0	guns
0	to
0	be
0	shotted
0	,
0	and
0	every
0	man
0	to
0	his
0	post
0	.

0	About
0	six
0	,
0	they
0	departed
0	,
0	without
0	offering
0	the
0	least
0	insult
0	;

0	but
0	soon
0	after
0	we
0	saw
0	,
0	upon
0	a
0	high
0	hill
0	,
0	a
0	large
0	body
0	assembled
0	,
0	who
0	were
0	observed
0	to
0	be
0	gathering
0	stones
0	,
0	and
0	laying
0	them
0	in
0	heaps
0	.

0	At
0	dark
0	they
0	were
0	seen
0	to
0	disperse
0	;

0	but
0	great
0	lights
0	and
0	fires
0	were
0	kept
0	burning
0	all
0	night
0	.

0	In
0	the
0	morning
0	of
0	the
0	13th
0	,
0	they
0	again
0	assembled
0	,
0	and
0	began
0	rolling
0	the
0	stones
0	from
0	the
0	brink
0	of
0	the
0	hill
0	,
0	in
0	order
0	,
0	as
0	we
0	supposed
0	,
0	to
0	divert
0	our
0	attention
0	,
0	but
0	which
0	rather
0	served
0	to
0	awaken
0	our
0	fears
0	.

0	Our
0	Captains
0	looking
0	upon
0	this
0	as
0	an
0	insult
0	,
0	ordered
0	the
0	guns
0	to
0	be
0	levelled
0	,
0	and
0	fired
0	among
0	them
0	,
0	and
0	in
0	ten
0	minutes
0	there
0	was
0	not
0	an
0	Indian
0	to
0	be
0	seen
0	near
0	the
0	place
0	.

0	In
0	the
0	afternoon
0	,
0	the
0	King
0	came
0	on
0	board
0	the
0	Resolution
0	,
0	and
0	complained
0	to
PERSON-B	Capt.
PERSON-I	Cook
0	of
0	our
0	killing
0	two
0	of
0	his
0	people
0	,
0	intimating
0	at
0	the
0	same
0	time
0	,
0	that
0	they
0	had
0	not
0	the
0	least
0	intention
0	of
0	hurting
0	us
0	.

0	He
0	continued
0	on
0	board
0	some
0	hours
0	,
0	amusing
0	himself
0	with
0	seeing
0	the
0	armourers
0	at
0	work
0	;

0	and
0	when
0	he
0	departed
0	,
0	requested
0	that
0	they
0	might
0	be
0	permitted
0	to
0	make
0	him
0	a
0	Pahoo-a
0	,
0	(
0	an
0	instrument
0	they
0	use
0	in
0	battle
0	when
0	they
0	come
0	to
0	close
0	quarters
0	)
0	which
0	was
0	readily
0	granted
0	.

0	From
0	this
0	time
0	forward
0	the
0	natives
0	became
0	very
0	tumultuous
0	and
0	unruly
0	,
0	and
0	stole
0	every
0	thing
0	they
0	could
0	lay
0	their
0	hands
0	on
0	,
0	with
0	any
0	tolerable
0	chance
0	of
0	escaping
0	.

0	They
0	were
0	fired
0	upon
0	,
0	but
0	that
0	only
0	enraged
0	them
0	.

0	One
0	who
0	had
0	just
0	stolen
0	the
0	armourer
0	's
0	tongs
0	and
0	an
0	iron
0	chisel
0	,
0	with
0	both
0	which
0	he
0	was
0	making
0	to
0	shore
0	,
0	was
0	intercepted
0	by
PERSON-B	Capt.
PERSON-I	Cook
0	himself
0	,
0	who
0	,
0	with
0	a
0	few
0	marines
0	,
0	endeavoured
0	to
0	seize
0	him
0	as
0	he
0	was
0	landing
0	;

0	but
0	the
0	Indians
0	seeing
0	his
0	design
0	,
0	came
0	rushing
0	in
0	a
0	body
0	to
0	the
0	water-side
0	,
0	among
0	whom
0	the
0	fellow
0	found
0	means
0	to
0	secrete
0	himself
0	;

0	and
0	the
0	multitude
0	,
0	instead
0	of
0	delivering
0	him
0	up
0	,
0	attacked
0	the
0	boats
0	that
0	were
0	in
0	pursuit
0	of
0	him
0	,
0	seized
0	their
0	oars
0	,
0	broke
0	them
0	,
0	and
0	forced
0	our
0	whole
0	party
0	to
0	retreat
0	.

PERSON-B	Capt.
PERSON-I	Cook
0	having
0	only
0	a
0	few
0	marines
0	with
0	him
0	,
0	part
0	of
0	those
0	who
0	were
0	placed
0	as
0	a
0	guard
0	to
0	the
0	carpenters
0	employed
0	upon
0	the
0	mast
0	,
0	did
0	not
0	think
0	proper
0	to
0	renew
0	the
0	attack
0	;

0	but
0	returned
0	to
0	the
0	tents
0	,
0	ordering
0	a
0	strict
0	watch
0	to
0	be
0	kept
0	during
0	the
0	night
0	,
0	and
0	his
0	whole
0	force
0	to
0	be
0	kept
0	under
0	arms
0	till
0	the
0	matter
0	should
0	be
0	accommodated
0	.

0	For
0	this
0	purpose
0	,
PERSON-B	Mr.
PERSON-I	Edgar
0	,
0	our
0	master
0	,
0	was
0	sent
0	with
0	a
0	message
0	to
0	the
0	young
0	prince
0	,
0	who
0	from
0	the
0	beginning
0	had
0	behaved
0	friendly
0	,
0	to
0	acquaint
0	him
0	with
0	the
0	cause
0	of
0	the
0	fray
0	,
0	and
0	to
0	demand
0	the
0	delinquent
0	to
0	be
0	delivered
0	up
0	.

0	The
0	prince
0	,
0	instead
0	of
0	listening
0	to
0	his
0	remonstrances
0	,
0	assumed
0	another
0	countenance
0	,
0	and
PERSON-B	Mr.
PERSON-I	Edgar
0	was
0	very
0	roughly
0	handled
0	,
0	and
0	glad
0	to
0	make
0	his
0	escape
0	with
0	a
0	sound
0	beating
0	.

0	The
0	temper
0	of
0	the
0	Indians
0	was
0	now
0	totally
0	changed
0	,
0	and
0	they
0	became
0	every
0	day
0	more
0	and
0	more
0	troublesome
0	.

0	On
0	the
0	14th
0	,
0	a
0	vast
0	multitude
0	of
0	them
0	were
0	seen
0	together
0	,
0	making
0	great
0	lamentation
0	,
0	and
0	moving
0	slowly
0	along
0	to
0	the
0	beating
0	of
0	a
0	drum
0	,
0	that
0	scarce
0	gave
0	a
0	stroke
0	in
0	a
0	minute
0	.

0	From
0	this
0	circumstance
0	,
0	it
0	was
0	supposed
0	they
0	were
0	burying
0	the
0	dead
0	,
0	who
0	had
0	been
0	killed
0	the
0	day
0	before
0	.

0	No
0	violence
0	,
0	however
0	,
0	was
0	either
0	done
0	or
0	attempted
0	this
0	day
0	,
0	though
0	the
0	girls
0	that
0	were
0	on
0	board
0	gave
0	us
0	to
0	understand
0	,
0	that
0	their
0	countrymen
0	only
0	waited
0	a
0	favourable
0	opportunity
0	to
0	attack
0	the
0	ships
0	.

0	On
0	the
0	morning
0	of
0	the
0	15th
0	,
0	our
0	great
0	cutter
0	,
0	which
0	was
0	moored
0	to
0	the
0	buoy
0	,
0	was
0	missing
0	from
0	her
0	moorings
0	,
0	and
0	,
0	upon
0	examination
0	,
0	the
0	boat
0	's
0	painter
0	was
0	found
0	cut
0	two
0	fathoms
0	from
0	the
0	buoy
0	,
0	and
0	the
0	remainder
0	of
0	the
0	rope
0	gone
0	with
0	the
0	boat
0	.

0	This
0	gave
0	cause
0	to
0	suspect
0	that
0	some
0	villainy
0	was
0	concerting
0	;

0	and
0	,
0	in
0	order
0	to
0	prevent
0	the
0	ill-consequences
0	that
0	might
0	follow
0	,
0	both
0	Captains
0	met
0	on
0	board
0	the
0	Resolution
0	,
0	to
0	consult
0	what
0	was
0	best
0	to
0	be
0	done
0	on
0	this
0	critical
0	occasion
0	.

0	The
0	officers
0	from
0	both
0	ships
0	were
0	present
0	at
0	this
0	council
0	,
0	where
0	it
0	was
0	resolved
0	to
0	seize
0	the
0	King
0	,
0	and
0	to
0	confine
0	him
0	on
0	board
0	till
0	the
0	boat
0	should
0	be
0	returned
0	.

0	With
0	this
0	view
0	,
0	early
0	on
0	the
0	morning
0	of
0	the
0	16th
0	,
PERSON-B	Capt.
PERSON-I	Cook
0	,
0	with
PERSON-B	Mr.
PERSON-I	Phillips
0	,
0	Lieutenant
0	of
0	Marines
0	,
0	and
0	nine
0	of
0	his
0	men
0	,
0	went
0	on
0	shore
0	,
0	under
0	cover
0	of
0	the
0	guns
0	of
0	both
0	ships
0	,
0	to
0	one
0	side
0	of
0	the
0	bay
0	where
0	the
0	King
0	resided
0	;

0	and
PERSON-B	Mr.
PERSON-I	King
0	,
0	second
0	Lieutenant
0	of
0	the
0	Resolution
0	,
0	who
0	had
0	always
0	been
0	stationed
0	with
0	a
0	guard
0	to
0	protect
0	the
0	working
0	party
0	and
0	the
0	waterers
0	on
0	shore
0	,
0	went
0	,
0	as
0	usual
0	,
0	to
0	the
0	other
0	side
0	.

0	The
0	Indians
0	,
0	observing
0	our
0	motions
0	,
0	and
0	seeing
0	the
0	ships
0	warping
0	towards
0	the
0	towns
0	,
0	of
0	which
0	there
0	were
0	two
0	,
0	one
0	on
0	each
0	side
0	the
0	bay
0	,
0	they
0	concluded
0	that
0	our
0	design
0	was
0	to
0	seize
0	their
0	marine
0	.

0	In
0	consequence
0	of
0	which
0	,
0	most
0	of
0	their
0	large
0	war
0	canoes
0	took
0	the
0	alarm
0	,
0	and
0	were
0	making
0	off
0	,
0	when
0	our
0	guns
0	,
0	loaded
0	with
0	grape
0	and
0	canister
0	shot
0	,
0	drove
0	them
0	back
0	;

0	and
0	the
0	Captain
0	and
0	his
0	guard
0	landed
0	without
0	opposition
0	.

0	We
0	observed
0	,
0	however
0	,
0	that
0	their
0	warriors
0	were
0	clothed
0	in
0	their
0	military
0	dress
0	,
0	though
0	without
0	arms
0	,
0	and
0	that
0	they
0	were
0	gathering
0	together
0	in
0	a
0	body
0	from
0	every
0	direction
0	,
0	their
0	Chiefs
0	assuming
0	a
0	very
0	different
0	countenance
0	to
0	what
0	they
0	usually
0	wore
0	upon
0	all
0	former
0	occasions
0	.

0	However
0	,
PERSON-B	Capt.
PERSON-I	Cook
0	,
0	attended
0	by
0	the
0	Lieutenant
0	of
0	Marines
0	,
0	a
0	Serjeant
0	,
0	and
0	nine
0	privates
0	,
0	regardless
0	of
0	appearances
0	,
0	proceeded
0	directly
0	to
0	the
0	King
0	's
0	residence
0	,
0	where
0	they
0	found
0	him
0	seated
0	on
0	the
0	ground
0	,
0	with
0	about
0	twelve
0	of
0	his
0	Chiefs
0	round
0	him
0	,
0	who
0	all
0	prostrated
0	themselves
0	on
0	seeing
PERSON-B	the
PERSON-I	Orono
0	enter
0	.

0	The
0	Captain
0	addressed
0	the
0	King
0	in
0	the
0	mildest
0	terms
0	,
0	assuring
0	him
0	that
0	no
0	violence
0	was
0	intended
0	against
0	his
0	person
0	or
0	any
0	of
0	his
0	people
0	,
0	except
0	against
0	those
0	who
0	had
0	been
0	guilty
0	of
0	a
0	most
0	unprecedented
0	act
0	of
0	robbery
0	,
0	by
0	cutting
0	from
0	her
0	moorings
0	one
0	of
0	the
0	ship
0	's
0	boats
0	,
0	without
0	which
0	they
0	could
0	neither
0	conveniently
0	water
0	the
0	ships
0	,
0	nor
0	carry
0	on
0	the
0	necessary
0	communication
0	with
0	the
0	shore
0	;

0	calling
0	upon
0	the
0	King
0	,
0	at
0	the
0	same
0	time
0	,
0	to
0	give
0	orders
0	for
0	the
0	boat
0	to
0	be
0	immediately
0	restored
0	,
0	and
0	inviting
0	him
0	,
0	in
0	the
0	most
0	friendly
0	manner
0	,
0	to
0	accompany
0	him
0	on
0	board
0	,
0	till
0	his
0	orders
0	should
0	be
0	carried
0	into
0	execution
0	.

0	The
0	King
0	protested
0	his
0	total
0	ignorance
0	of
0	the
0	theft
0	;

0	said
0	,
0	he
0	was
0	very
0	ready
0	to
0	assist
0	in
0	discovering
0	the
0	thief
0	,
0	and
0	should
0	be
0	glad
0	to
0	see
0	him
0	punished
0	;

0	and
0	shewed
0	no
0	unwillingness
0	himself
0	to
0	trust
0	his
0	person
0	with
PERSON-B	the
PERSON-I	Orono
0	,
0	though
0	he
0	had
0	lately
0	exercised
0	very
0	unusual
0	severities
0	against
0	his
0	people
0	.

0	He
0	was
0	told
0	that
0	the
0	tumultuous
0	appearance
0	of
0	his
0	people
0	,
0	and
0	their
0	repeated
0	robberies
0	,
0	made
0	some
0	uncommon
0	severities
0	necessary
0	;

0	but
0	that
0	not
0	the
0	least
0	hurt
0	should
0	be
0	done
0	to
0	the
0	meanest
0	inhabitant
0	of
0	his
0	island
0	by
0	any
0	person
0	belonging
0	to
0	the
0	ships
0	,
0	without
0	exemplary
0	punishment
0	;

0	and
0	all
0	that
0	was
0	necessary
0	for
0	the
0	continuance
0	of
0	peace
0	was
0	,
0	to
0	pledge
0	himself
0	for
0	the
0	honesty
0	of
0	his
0	people
0	.

0	With
0	that
0	view
0	,
0	and
0	that
0	view
0	only
0	,
0	the
0	Captain
0	said
0	he
0	came
0	to
0	request
0	the
0	King
0	to
0	place
0	confidence
0	in
0	him
0	,
0	and
0	to
0	make
0	his
0	ship
0	his
0	residence
0	,
0	as
0	the
0	most
0	effectual
0	means
0	of
0	putting
0	a
0	stop
0	to
0	the
0	robberies
0	that
0	were
0	now
0	daily
0	and
0	hourly
0	committed
0	and
0	committing
0	,
0	by
0	his
0	people
0	,
0	both
0	at
0	the
0	tents
0	and
0	on
0	board
0	the
0	ships
0	,
0	and
0	were
0	so
0	daring
0	as
0	to
0	become
0	insufferable
0	.

0	The

0	as
0	the

0	were
0	dispersed
0	from

0	Our
0	whole

0	therefore
0	collected
0	,

0	,
0	having
0	landed
0	under

0	of
0	our

0	,
0	we
0	marched
0	rapidly
0	up
0	the

0	,
0	with
0	bayonets
0	fixed
0	,

0	,
0	which

0	on

0	but
0	were

0	After

0	for

0	that

0	of

0	,
0	and
0	joyfully
0	swam
0	on

0	,
0	that
0	now
0	we

0	but
0	notwithstanding
0	this

0	dissembled

0	,
0	our

0	who

0	that
0	the

0	were
0	then
0	on
0	the

0	,
0	cutting

0	While
0	we
0	remained
0	in

0	,
0	several

0	came
0	to
0	the

0	;

0	and
0	one
0	in
0	particular
0	,
0	with
PERSON-B	Capt.
PERSON-I	Cook
0	's
0	hanger
0	,
0	which
0	he
0	drew
0	in
0	a
0	vaunting
0	manner
0	,
0	and
0	brandished
0	it
0	over
0	his
0	head
0	;

0	others
0	shewed
0	themselves
0	with
0	the

0	taken
0	from

0	;

0	one
0	having
0	a

0	,
0	another
0	a
0	shirt
0	,
0	a
0	third
0	a
0	pair
0	of

0	,
0	and
0	so
0	on
0	;

0	insulting
0	us
0	,
0	as
0	it
0	were
0	,
0	with
0	the
0	trophies
0	of
0	their
0	victory
0	.

0	At
0	this
0	time
0	it
0	was
0	thought
0	prudent
0	to
0	stifle
0	our
0	resentment
0	,
0	and
0	to
0	reserve
0	our
0	vengeance
0	till
0	a
0	more
0	favourable
0	opportunity
0	.

0	We
0	were
0	now
0	in
0	want
0	of
0	water
0	;

0	our

0	and
0	rigging

0	our

0	,
0	and
0	our
0	repairs
0	not
0	near
0	finished
0	;

0	all
0	therefore
0	we
0	had
0	to
0	do
0	,
0	was
0	to
0	remain
0	upon
0	the
0	defensive
0	till
0	we
0	were
0	better
0	provided
0	.

0	At
0	the
0	close
0	of
0	the
0	evening
0	,
0	as
0	soon
0	as
0	it
0	was
0	dark
0	,
0	a
0	canoe
0	was
0	heard
0	paddling
0	towards
0	the
0	Resolution
0	,
0	in
0	which
0	were
0	two
0	men
0	.

0	As
0	it
0	approached
0	,
0	both
0	sentinels
0	fired
0	,
0	but
0	without
0	hurting
0	either
0	of
0	the
0	men
0	,
0	though
0	the
0	balls
0	went
0	through
0	the
0	bottom
0	of
0	the
0	canoe
0	.

0	Notwithstanding
0	this
0	,
0	the
0	canoe
0	came
0	close
0	under
0	the
0	ship
0	's
0	stern
0	;

0	and
0	one
0	of
0	the
0	men
0	calling
0	out
PERSON-B	Tinne
0	,
PERSON-B	Tinne
0	,
0	(
0	the
0	name
PERSON-B	Mr.
PERSON-I	King
0	was
0	known
0	by
0	)
0	whom
0	the
0	Priests
0	had
0	always
0	supposed
0	to
0	be
PERSON-B	the
PERSON-I	Orono
0	's
0	son
0	,
0	and
0	,
0	therefore
0	,
0	the
0	Earee
0	of
0	the
0	ship
0	,
0	this
0	excited
0	every
0	one
0	's
0	curiosity
0	,
0	and
0	orders
0	were
0	given
0	to
0	admit
0	them
0	on
0	board
0	;

0	they
0	were
0	priests
0	,
0	and
0	produced
0	a
0	piece
0	of
0	flesh
0	,
0	carefully
0	wrapped
0	up
0	in
0	a
0	cloth
0	,
0	which
0	they
0	solemnly
0	assured
0	us
0	was
0	part
0	of
0	the
0	thigh
0	of
0	our
0	late
0	Commander
0	;

0	that
0	he
0	saw
0	it
0	cut
0	from
0	the
0	bone
0	,
0	but
0	believed
0	that
0	all
0	the
0	flesh
0	of
0	the
0	body
0	was
0	burnt
0	;

0	that
0	the
0	head
0	and
0	all
0	the
0	bones
0	,
0	except
0	what
0	belonged
0	to
0	the
0	trunk
0	,
0	were
0	in
0	the
0	possession
0	of
0	Terreoboo
0	,
0	and
0	the
0	other
0	Chiefs
0	;

0	that
0	what
0	we
0	saw
0	,
0	had
0	been
0	brought
0	to
PERSON-B	Kaoa
PERSON-I	,
PERSON-I	the
PERSON-I	High
PERSON-I	Priest
0	,
0	to
0	be
0	made
0	use
0	of
0	in
0	some
0	religious
0	ceremony
0	;

0	and
0	that
0	he
0	had
0	sent
0	it
0	as
0	a
0	proof
0	of
0	the
0	sincerity
0	of
0	his
0	innocence
0	and
0	his
0	friendship
0	.

0	Being
0	asked
0	,
0	if
0	any
0	part
0	of
0	the
0	flesh
0	had
0	been
0	eaten
0	,
0	they
0	expressed
0	the
0	utmost
0	horror
0	at
0	the
0	idea
0	.

0	They
0	afterwards
0	asked
0	,
0	with
0	some
0	apparent
0	apprehension
0	,
0	when
PERSON-B	the
PERSON-I	Orono
0	would
0	come
0	again
0	,
0	and
0	what
0	he
0	would
0	do
0	to
0	them
0	on
0	his
0	return
0	?

0	The
0	same
0	question
0	had
0	been
0	asked
0	by
0	others
0	,
0	which
0	shews
0	,
0	the
0	opinion
0	they
0	entertain
0	of
0	the
0	spirit
0	's
0	power
0	after
0	it
0	is
0	separated
0	from
0	the
0	body
0	.

0	They
0	then
0	desired
0	to
0	be
0	set
0	at
0	liberty
0	,
0	which
0	was
0	granted
0	.

0	One
0	of
0	the
0	men
0	was
0	the
0	Priest
0	who
0	had
0	attended
PERSON-B	Capt.
PERSON-I	Cook
0	,
0	and
0	who
0	was
0	ready
0	on
0	all
0	occasions
0	,
0	to
0	fall
0	down
0	and
0	worship
0	him
0	.

0	He
0	lamented
0	his
0	loss
0	with
0	abundance
0	of
0	tears
0	,
0	and
0	earnestly
0	besought
0	us
0	to
0	keep
0	their
0	coming
0	a
0	secret
0	,
0	for
0	if
0	it
0	should
0	be
0	known
0	,
0	it
0	would
0	prove
0	fatal
0	to
0	their
0	whole
0	fraternity
0	.

0	They
0	farther
0	informed
0	us
0	,
0	that
0	17
0	of
0	their
0	countrymen
0	were
0	killed
0	in
0	the
0	first
0	action
0	at
0	Kowrowa
0	,
0	of
0	whom
0	five
0	were
0	Chiefs
0	;

0	and
0	that
0	Kaneena
0	and
0	his
0	brother
0	,
0	our
0	particular
0	friends
0	,
0	were
0	among
0	the
0	number
0	;

0	eight
0	,
0	they
0	said
0	,
0	were
0	killed
0	at
0	the
0	observatory
0	,
0	of
0	whom
0	three
0	were
0	of
0	the
0	first
0	rank
0	.

0	As
0	this
0	was
0	the
0	fact
0	,
0	the
0	story
0	that
0	was
0	given
0	out
0	to
0	conceal
0	it
0	,
0	may
0	be
0	worth
0	relating
0	.

0	On
0	the
0	19th
0	,
0	says
0	our
0	journalist
0	,
0	the
0	father
0	and
0	mother
0	of
0	two
0	girls
0	,
0	who
0	had
0	concealed
0	themselves
0	on
0	board
0	the
0	ship
0	,
0	came
0	in
0	the
0	dead
0	of
0	the
0	night
0	,
0	in
0	their
0	canoe
0	,
0	loaded
0	with
0	cocoa-nuts
0	and
0	bread-fruit
0	,
0	which
0	they
0	had
0	been
0	gathering
0	in
0	the
0	day
0	for
0	their
0	own
0	subsistence
0	,
0	as
0	a
0	supply
0	for
0	their
0	children
0	,
0	lest
0	,
0	from
0	what
0	had
0	happened
0	,
0	they
0	should
0	have
0	been
0	suffered
0	to
0	die
0	for
0	want
0	;

0	acquainting
0	us
0	at
0	the
0	same
0	time
0	with
0	a
0	treacherous
0	design
0	of
0	their
0	countrymen
0	to
0	cut
0	our
0	cables
0	,
0	and
0	drift
0	the
0	ships
0	ashore
0	.

0	They
0	were
0	taken
0	on
0	board
0	,
0	and
0	detained
0	prisoners
0	till
0	morning
0	,
0	when
0	not
0	an
0	Indian
0	was
0	to
0	be
0	seen
0	near
0	the
0	harbour
0	,
0	but
0	such
0	as
0	were

0	feeble
0	,
0	and
0	knew
0	not
0	how
0	to
0	make
0	their
0	escape
0	.

0	The
0	informers
0	were
0	tenderly
0	treated
0	,
0	had
0	presents
0	made
0	them
0	,
0	and
0	were
0	afterwards
0	dismissed

0	—
0	The
0	truth

0	,
0	the
0	Priests
0	had

0	by
0	which
0	they
0	might
0	have
0	been
0	discovered
0	,
0	and
0	perhaps
0	put
0	to
0	death
0	.

0	Among
0	other
0	incidents
0	of
0	the
0	present
0	day
0	,
0	Feb.
0	16
0	,
0	there
0	was
0	one
0	which
0	could
0	not
0	be
0	understood
0	.

0	Two
0	boys
0	were
0	seen
0	swimming
0	towards
0	the
0	ships
0	,
0	singing
0	,
0	as
0	they
0	approached
0	the
0	ships
0	,
0	a
0	mournful
0	and
0	plaintive
0	song
0	.

0	They
0	had
0	each
0	a
0	long
0	spear
0	in
0	his
0	hand
0	,
0	which
0	,
0	on
0	boarding
0	the
0	Discovery
0	,
0	they
0	delivered
0	to
0	the
0	Officer
0	on
0	the
0	deck
0	,
0	and
0	then
0	departed
0	.

0	Who
0	sent
0	them
0	,
0	or
0	for
0	what
0	purpose
0	,
0	we
0	never
0	could
0	learn
0	.

0	On
0	the
0	17th
0	,
0	the
0	different
0	promotions
0	took
0	place
0	,
0	and
0	according
0	to
0	their
0	succession
0	,
0	the
0	Officers
0	changed
0	ships
0	;

PERSON-B	Capt.
PERSON-I	Clerke
0	went
0	on
0	board
0	Page
0	311
0	the
0	Resolution
0	,
0	and
PERSON-B	Mr.
PERSON-I	Gore
0	,
0	first
0	Lieutenant
0	of
0	the
0	Resolution
0	,
0	took
0	the
0	command
0	of
0	the
0	Discovery
0	.

0	On
0	the
0	18th
0	both
0	ships
0	were
0	again
0	warped
0	near
0	the
0	shore
0	,
0	and
0	a
0	spring
0	put
0	upon
0	their
0	cables
0	,
0	in
0	order
0	to
0	cover
0	the
0	boats
0	which
0	were
0	sent
0	to
0	compleat
0	our
0	complement
0	of
0	water
0	.

0	On
0	this
0	motion
0	crowds
0	of
0	inhabitants
0	were
0	seen
0	to
0	assemble
0	,
0	with
0	a
0	large
0	black
0	flag
0	displayed
0	,
0	which
0	we
0	interpreted
0	as
0	a
0	signal
0	for
0	war
0	;

0	but
0	we
0	afterwards
0	found
0	that
0	it
0	was
0	part
0	of
0	their
0	ceremony
0	in
0	burying
0	their
0	dead
0	.

0	Under
0	this
0	mistake
0	a
0	few
0	guns
0	were
0	fired
0	from
0	the
0	ships
0	to
0	disperse
0	them
0	,
0	by
0	which
0	the
0	King
0	's
0	nephew
0	,
PLACE-B	Maiha
PLACE-I	Maiha
0	,
0	was
0	wounded
0	,
0	and
0	a
0	poor
0	woman
0	lost
0	her
0	arm
0	.

0	This
0	made
0	a
0	strong
0	impression
0	on
0	the
0	whole
0	body
0	of
0	Indians
0	,
0	and
0	we
0	were
0	left
0	in
0	quiet
0	both
0	this
0	and
0	the
0	next
0	day
0	,
0	to
0	pursue
0	our
0	repairs
0	and
0	compleat
0	our
0	hold
0	.

0	On
0	the
0	19th
0	they
0	began
0	again
0	to
0	be
0	troublesome
0	.

0	In
0	the
0	morning
0	,
0	while
0	the
0	boats
0	were
0	loading
0	,
0	at
0	the
0	well
0	,
0	the
0	stones
0	came
0	about
0	the
0	watermen
0	like
0	hail
0	,
0	some
0	of
0	them
0	of
0	more
0	than
0	a
0	pound
0	weight
0	;

0	one
0	in
0	particular
0	was
0	seen
0	coming
0	;

0	but
0	who
0	threw
0	it
0	,
0	no
0	one
0	could
0	tell
0	.

0	This
0	being
0	attended
0	to
0	,
0	a
0	native
0	was
0	observed
0	to
0	creep
0	out
0	of
0	a
0	cavern
0	,
0	who
0	,
0	as
0	soon
0	as
0	he
0	had
0	discharged
0	his
0	stone
0	,
0	retired
0	back
0	to
0	his
0	place
0	of
0	shelter
0	.

0	Him
0	we
0	marked
0	,
0	and
0	returned
0	to
0	our
0	ships
0	;

0	and
0	it
0	being
0	now
0	apparent
0	that
0	nothing
0	was
0	to
0	be
0	gained
0	by
0	fair
0	means
0	,
0	orders
0	were
0	given
0	to
0	strike
0	terror
0	among
0	them
0	,
0	by
0	pursuing
0	them
0	with
0	fire
0	and
0	sword
0	.

0	About
0	two
0	in
0	the
0	afternoon
0	,
0	all
0	who
0	were
0	able
0	to
0	bear
0	arms
0	,
0	as
0	well
0	sailors
0	and
0	artificers
0	as
0	marines
0	,
0	were
0	mustered
0	,
0	and
0	preparations
0	made
0	to
0	sustain
0	them
0	,
0	while
0	with
0	lighted
0	torches
0	they
0	rowed
0	on
0	shore
0	,
0	and
0	set
0	fire
0	to
0	the
0	S.
0	E.
0	town
0	,
0	pursuing
0	the
0	frighted
0	inhabitants
0	while
0	their
0	houses
0	were
0	in
0	flames
0	,
0	with
0	unrelenting
0	fury
0	.

0	Many
0	were
0	put
0	to
0	death
0	,
0	and
0	all
0	driven
0	to
0	seek
0	shelter
0	where
0	they
0	could
0	,
0	scarce
0	a
0	house
0	having
0	escaped
0	the
0	general
0	conflagration
0	.

0	In
0	this
0	vindictive
0	enterprize
0	,
0	the
0	cavern
0	or
0	hole
0	of
0	the
0	crafty
0	Indian
0	,
0	whose
0	insolence
0	had
0	been
0	one
0	principal
0	cause
0	of
0	the
0	desolation
0	that
0	followed
0	,
0	was
0	not
0	forgotten
0	.

0	His
0	cavern
0	had
0	been
0	marked
0	,
0	as
0	has
0	already
0	been
0	observed
0	,
0	and
0	on
0	seeing
0	our
0	sailors
0	approach
0	it
0	,
0	such
0	was
0	his
0	inveteracy
0	,
0	that
0	he
0	heaved
0	a
0	huge
0	stone
0	at
0	the
0	assailants
0	,
0	one
0	of
0	whom
0	he
0	dangerously
0	wounded
0	,
0	but
0	was
0	instantly
0	dispatched
0	by
0	the
0	discharge
0	of
0	three
0	muskets
0	,
0	and
0	a
0	bayonet
0	run
0	through
0	his
0	body
0	.

0	Our
0	vengeance
0	being
0	now
0	fully
0	executed
0	,
0	we
0	returned
0	to
0	the
0	ships
0	,
0	loaded
0	with
0	the
0	spoils
0	of
0	the
0	towns
0	,
0	consisting
0	of
0	bows
0	and
0	arrows
0	,
0	clubs
0	,
0	and
0	arms
0	of
0	all
0	kinds
0	,
0	which
0	they
0	use
0	in
0	battle
0	;

0	and
0	having
0	the
0	heads
0	of
0	two
0	of
0	their
0	fighting
0	men
0	,
0	of
0	which
0	the
0	courageous
0	native
0	was
0	one
0	,
0	stuck
0	at
0	the
0	bows
0	of
0	the
0	pinnaces
0	,
0	as
0	a
0	terror
0	to
0	the
0	enemy
0	from
0	ever
0	daring
0	again
0	to
0	molest
0	us
0	.

0	About
0	four
0	in
0	the
0	afternoon
0	of
0	the
0	20th
0	,
0	ten
0	girls
0	came
0	down
0	to
0	the
0	well
0	,
0	where
0	the
0	waterers
0	were
0	busy
0	,
0	with
0	quantities
0	of
0	fruit
0	,
0	as
0	much
0	as
0	they
0	could
0	carry
0	,
0	for
0	which
0	they
0	would
0	take
0	nothing
0	in
0	return
0	,
0	only
0	praying
0	to
0	be
0	taken
0	on
0	board
0	.

0	This
0	was
0	denied
0	them
0	,
0	as
0	peremptory
0	orders
0	had
0	been
0	given
0	by
PERSON-B	Capt.
PERSON-I	Clerke
0	,
0	forbidding
0	the
0	admission
0	of
0	any
0	more
0	of
0	their
0	women
0	.

0	This
0	day
0	,
0	in
0	the
0	morning
0	,
0	a
0	Chief
0	was
0	seen
0	coming
0	down
0	the
0	hill
0	,
0	followed
0	by
0	a
0	number
0	of
0	boys
0	,
0	with
0	a
0	white
0	flag
0	displayed
0	,
0	and
0	carrying
0	boughs
0	and
0	green
0	branches
0	in
0	their
0	hands
0	.

0	They
0	came
0	singing
0	to
0	the
0	water
0	side
0	;

0	but
0	that
0	did
0	not
0	prevent
0	their
0	receiving
0	the
0	fire
0	of
0	a
0	party
0	that
0	was
0	placed
0	as
0	a
0	guard
0	.

0	On
0	seeing
0	his
0	ensign
0	answered
0	by
0	a
0	white
0	flag
0	at
0	each
0	mizen-top-mast-head
0	,
0	he
0	,
0	accompanied
0	with
0	three
0	other
0	Chiefs
0	,
0	came
0	on
0	board
0	,
0	having
0	some
0	cocoa-nuts
0	,
0	plantains
0	,
0	and
0	bread-fruit
0	,
0	as
0	presents
0	to
0	the
0	Commander
0	,
0	for
0	which
0	they
0	would
0	accept
0	of
0	nothing
0	in
0	return
0	.

0	This
0	Chief
0	,
0	whose
0	name
0	was
0	Eappo
0	,
0	came
0	to
0	make
0	submission
0	;

0	and
0	,
0	as
0	a
0	token
0	of
0	his
0	sincerity
0	,
0	promised
0	to
0	collect
0	the
0	bones
0	of
0	our
0	deceased
0	warrior
0	,
0	as
0	he
0	called
0	him
0	,
0	and
0	to
0	bring
0	them
0	,
0	and
0	lay
0	them
0	at
0	our
0	feet
0	.

0	This
0	was
0	the
0	token
0	of
0	the
0	most
0	perfect
0	submission
0	that
0	a
0	native
0	warrior
0	could
0	make
0	to
0	his
0	conqueror
0	;

0	and
0	this
0	was
0	accepted
0	on
0	the
0	part
0	of
0	our
0	Commander
0	.

0	In
0	this
0	manner
0	,
0	and
0	on
0	these
0	conditions
0	,
0	peace
0	was
0	to
0	be
0	restored
0	.

0	At
0	nine
0	in
0	the
0	morning
0	of
0	the
0	next
0	day
0	,
0	the
0	same
0	old
0	Chief
0	returned
0	,
0	attended
0	by
0	a
0	more
0	numerous
0	suit
0	than
0	before
0	,
0	having
0	several
0	large
0	hogs
0	added
0	to
0	his
0	peace-offerings
0	;

0	and
0	with
0	him
0	,
0	likewise
0	,
0	he
0	brought
0	the
0	bones
0	of
PERSON-B	Capt.
PERSON-I	Cook
0	,
0	his
0	back-bone
0	,
0	and
0	the
0	bones
0	of
0	his
0	feet
0	only
0	excepted
0	,
0	which
0	he
0	promised
0	to
0	produce
0	the
0	next
0	visit
0	he
0	made
0	.

0	On
0	examination
0	,
0	the
0	head
0	appeared
0	to
0	have
0	been
0	scalped
0	;

0	the
0	face
0	was
0	entirely
0	gone
0	;

0	the
0	hands
0	had
0	the
0	flesh
0	on
0	,
0	but
0	scored
0	and
0	salted
0	;

0	and
0	,
0	as
0	he
0	assured
0	the
0	Captain
0	,
0	most
0	of
0	the
0	flesh
0	besides
0	was
0	burnt
0	.

0	Our
0	Commander
0	made
0	signs
0	to
0	return
0	the
0	cutter
0	,
0	but
0	was
0	told
0	it
0	was
0	broke
0	up
0	and
0	burnt
0	for
0	the
0	iron
0	.

0	The
0	arms
0	belonging
0	to
0	the
0	marines
0	,
0	who
0	were
0	killed
0	,
0	were
0	next
0	demanded
0	;

0	but
0	these
0	,
0	it
0	was
0	said
0	,
0	were
0	carried
0	up
0	the
0	country
0	by
0	common
0	people
0	,
0	and
0	were
0	irrecoverable
0	.

0	Some
0	presents
0	were
0	made
0	to
0	this
0	friendly
0	Chief
0	,
0	who
0	departed
0	well
0	satisfied
0	.

0	We
0	were
0	now
0	preparing
0	to
0	depart
0	,
0	when
0	provisions
0	of
0	all
0	sorts
0	came
0	pouring
0	in
0	upon
0	us
0	faster
0	than
0	we
0	could
0	consume
0	them
0	.

0	The
0	Chief
0	kept
0	his
0	promise
0	,
0	and
0	On
0	the
0	23d
0	,
0	Eappo
0	and
0	the
0	King
0	's
0	son
0	,
0	came
0	on
0	board
0	,
0	and
0	brought
0	the
0	bones
0	of
0	the
0	Captain
0	that
0	were
0	missing
0	:
0	these
0	were
0	all
0	placed
0	in
0	due
0	form
0	,
0	in
0	a
0	case
0	made
0	for
0	the
0	purpose
0	,
0	and
0	under
0	a
0	triple
0	discharge
0	from
0	the
0	ships
0	,
0	buried
0	in
0	the
0	bay
0	.

0	The
0	terror
0	of
0	the
0	natives
0	on
0	this
0	occasion
0	was
0	increased
0	,
0	by
0	a
0	four
0	pound
0	ball
0	being
0	loaded
0	by
0	mistake
0	,
0	which
0	fortunately
0	did
0	no
0	other
0	mischief
0	than
0	that
0	of
0	exciting
0	the
0	jealousy
0	of
0	the
0	natives
0	,
0	that
0	our
0	professions
0	of
0	peace
0	were
0	not
0	sincere
0	;

0	which
0	possibly
0	might
0	be
0	the
0	case
0	with
0	him
0	who
0	loaded
0	the
0	gun
0	,
0	as
0	the
0	sailors
0	in
0	general
0	could
0	hardly
0	be
0	restrained
0	from
0	violence
0	,
0	whenever
0	a

0	came

0	power
0	.

0	Nothing
0	more
0	remained
0	now
0	to
0	be
0	done
0	.

0	This
0	day
0	we
0	had
0	the
0	satisfaction
0	of
0	getting
0	the
0	foremast
0	of
0	the
0	Resolution
0	shipt
0	,
0	which
0	was
0	a
0	work
0	of
0	great
0	labour
0	,
0	and
0	some
0	difficulty
0	,
0	as
0	the
0	ropes
0	were
0	now
0	become
0	rotten
0	,
0	and
0	unable
0	to
0	sustain
0	the
0	purchase
0	;

0	however
0	,
0	that
0	being
0	at
0	length
0	accomplished
0	,
0	and
0	the
0	repairs
0	compleated
0	,
0	so
0	far
0	at
0	least
0	as
0	our
0	circumstances
0	would
0	allow
0	,
0	we
0	bent
0	our
0	sails
0	in
0	the
0	morning
0	;

0	and
0	were
0	visited
0	by
0	many
0	of
0	our
0	former
0	friends
0	,
0	among
0	whom
0	was
0	the
0	King
0	's
0	youngest
0	son
0	,
0	a
0	boy
0	of
0	about
0	fourteen
0	years
0	of
0	age
0	,
0	of
0	whom
PERSON-B	Capt.
PERSON-I	Cook
0	was
0	remarkably
0	fond
0	;

0	and
0	the
0	boy
0	,
0	in
0	return
0	,
0	was
0	no
0	less
0	attached
0	to
0	the
0	Captain
0	.

0	He
0	came
0	to
0	express
0	his
0	sorrow
0	for
0	the
0	accident
0	that
0	had
0	happened
0	,
0	which
0	he
0	did
0	by
0	a
0	plentiful
0	flow
0	of
0	tears
0	.

0	He
0	gave
0	us
0	to
0	understand
0	,
0	that
0	his
0	two
0	brothers
0	were
0	killed
0	,
0	and
0	that
0	his
0	father
0	was
0	retired
0	to
0	an
0	inaccessible
0	place
0	.

PERSON-B	Capt.
PERSON-I	Clerke
0	made
0	him
0	some
0	presents
0	that
0	were
0	pleasing
0	to
0	him
0	,
0	and
0	he
0	departed
0	very
0	much
0	comforted
0	.

0	About
0	7
0	in
0	the
0	evening
0	,
0	a
0	breeze
0	springing
0	up
0	in
0	our
0	favour
0	,
0	we
0	unmoored
0	,
0	and
0	soon
0	left
PLACE-B	Karakakooa
PLACE-I	Bay
0	,
0	for
0	that
0	was
0	the
0	name
0	of
0	the
0	bay
0	in
0	which
0	we
0	had
0	been
0	moored
0	,
0	shaping
0	our
0	course
0	to
0	the
0	N.
0	W.
0	Nothing
0	remarkable
0	till
0	The
0	28th
0	,
0	when
0	we
0	opened
0	upon
0	a
0	fine
0	bay
0	,
0	in
0	one
0	of
0	the
0	Leeward
PLACE-B	Islands
0	,
0	called
0	by
0	the
0	inhabitants
0	O-aa-ah
0	,
0	where
0	the
0	ships
0	came
0	to
0	an
0	anchor
0	,
0	and
0	where
0	both
0	Captains
0	landed
0	:
0	they
0	found
0	a
0	fine
0	running
0	river
0	,
0	but
0	brackish
0	towards
0	the
0	sea
0	;

0	they
0	therefore
0	made
0	a
0	very
0	short
0	stay
0	.

0	Several
0	of
0	the
0	inhabitants
0	came
0	on
0	board
0	,
0	who
0	were
0	so
0	immoderately
0	fond
0	of
0	iron
0	,
0	that
0	they
0	endeavoured
0	to
0	wrench
0	the
0	very
0	ring-bolts
0	from
0	the
0	hatches
0	.

0	Here
0	we
0	put
0	ashore
0	the
0	family
0	that
0	accompanied
0	us
0	from
0	O-why-e
0	,
0	and
0	here
0	we
0	purchased
0	a
0	few
0	small
0	swine
0	;

0	some
0	bread-fruit
0	and
0	plantains
0	,
0	and
0	a
0	quantity
0	of
0	a
0	root
0	called
0	Ta-ee
0	,
0	not
0	unlike
0	fern-root
0	,
0	but
0	of
0	an
0	enormous
0	size
0	,
0	some
0	weighing
0	from
0	60
0	to
0	70
0	pounds
0	.

0	It
0	is
0	a
0	powerful
0	anti-scorbutic
0	,
0	of
0	the
0	saccharine
0	kind
0	.

0	Pounded
0	,
0	we
0	made
0	an
0	excellent
0	liquor
0	from
0	it
0	,
0	very
0	pleasant
0	,
0	and
0	exceedingly
0	wholesome
0	.

0	We
0	had
0	quantities
0	of
0	it
0	when
0	we
0	reached
0	Kamshatska
0	,
0	and
0	as
0	good
0	as
0	when
0	first
0	purchased
0	.

0	Having
0	found
0	nothing
0	else
0	to
0	engage
0	our
0	attention
0	in
0	this
0	island
0	,
0	we
0	set
0	sail
0	in
0	the
0	evening
0	;

0	and
0	Next
0	day
0	,
0	March
0	1
0	,
0	about
0	noon
0	,
0	we
0	moored
0	in
0	our
0	old
0	birth
0	,
0	which
0	,
0	notwithstanding
0	,
0	had
0	a
0	most
0	beautiful
0	appearance
0	from
0	the
0	sea
0	,
0	being
0	well
0	cultivated
0	,
0	and
0	full
0	of
0	villages
0	.

0	We
0	made
0	sail
0	in
0	the
0	evening
0	for
0	Atooi
0	,
0	where
0	we
0	had
0	anchored
0	the
0	preceding
0	summer
0	.

0	We
0	learned
0	that
0	the
0	name
0	of
0	the
0	island
0	we
0	had
0	just
0	left
0	,
0	was
0	Woahoo
0	,
0	lat
0	.

0	21.50
0	.

0	N.
0	long
0	.

0	202.15
0	.

0	E.
0	Here
0	we
0	were
0	received
0	with
0	seeming
0	coolness
0	.

0	Hogs
0	,
0	and
0	the
0	produce
0	of
0	the
0	island
0	,
0	were
0	brought
0	us
0	indeed
0	in
0	abundance
0	;

0	but
0	when
0	our
0	casks
0	were
0	landed
0	,
0	in
0	order
0	to
0	exchange
0	our
0	water
0	(
0	that
0	of
0	O-why-he
0	being
0	both
0	bitter
0	and
0	brackish
0	,
0	and
0	the
0	water
0	here
0	excellent
0	)
0	the
0	coopers
0	were
0	no
0	sooner
0	set
0	to
0	work
0	,
0	than
0	one
0	native
0	snatched
0	up
0	an
0	adze
0	,
0	another
0	a
0	bucket
0	,
0	a
0	third
0	a
0	bag
0	of
0	nails
0	,
0	and
0	so
0	on
0	;

0	and
0	this
0	among
0	a
0	crowd
0	of
0	people
0	of
0	more
0	than
0	four
0	or
0	five
0	hundred
0	in
0	number
0	.

0	To
0	put
0	a
0	stop
0	to
0	these
0	depredations
0	,
0	orders
0	were
0	given
0	to
0	fire
0	over
0	their
0	heads
0	;

0	but
0	this
0	not
0	having
0	the
0	desired
0	effect
0	,
0	a
0	gun
0	from
0	the
0	ships
0	threw
0	them
0	all
0	into
0	confusion
0	.

0	Two
0	were
0	seen
0	to
0	drop
0	;

0	and
0	by
0	the
0	shrieks
0	and
0	cries
0	of
0	the
0	women
0	,
0	more
0	were
0	supposed
0	to
0	have
0	been
0	killed
0	or
0	wounded
0	.

0	For
0	a
0	while
0	the
0	multitude
0	retreated
0	;

0	but
0	being
0	rallied
0	by
0	some
0	of
0	their
0	Chiefs
0	,
0	who
0	doubtless
0	had
0	heard
0	that
0	we
0	were
0	not
0	invulnerable
0	,
0	they
0	returned
0	in
0	greater
0	numbers
0	than
0	before
0	,
0	when
0	it
0	was
0	thought
0	prudent
0	to
0	lay
0	aside
0	watering
0	,
0	and
0	to
0	provide
0	for
0	our
0	own
0	safety
0	.

0	All
0	hands
0	were
0	now
0	ordered
0	to
0	their
0	posts
0	,
0	and
0	an
0	engagement
0	commenced
0	in
0	earnest
0	,
0	when
0	the
0	Indians
0	instantly
0	gave
0	way
0	,
0	after
0	a
0	few
0	being
0	killed
0	and
0	wounded
0	by
0	our
0	fire
0	;

0	and
0	they
0	never
0	again
0	offered
0	the
0	least
0	violence
0	during
0	our
0	stay
0	.

0	A
0	perfect
0	agreement
0	took
0	place
0	,
0	and
0	presents
0	were
0	mutually
0	exchanged
0	on
0	both
0	sides
0	.

0	The
0	reason
0	assigned
0	for
0	our
0	cold
0	reception
0	at
0	first
0	,
0	was
0	,
0	because
0	we
0	had
0	introduced
0	among
0	their
0	women
0	a
0	bad
0	disorder
0	,
0	when
0	at
0	that
0	harbour
0	before
0	,
0	of
0	which
0	many
0	of
0	their
0	people
0	had
0	died
0	.

0	—
0	But
0	now
0	,
0	peace
0	being
0	established
0	,
0	all
0	the
0	bad
0	water
0	was
0	started
0	from
0	both
0	ships
0	,
0	and
0	a
0	plentiful
0	stock
0	of
0	good
0	water
0	taken
0	on
0	board
0	,
0	to
0	serve
0	us
0	during
0	our
0	long
0	run
0	to
0	Kamshatska
0	,
0	for
0	which
0	we
0	were
0	preparing
0	.

0	Here
0	one
0	of
0	the
0	Chiefs
0	,
0	named
0	Noo-oh-a
0	,
0	expressed
0	a
0	desire
0	to
0	accompany
0	us
0	in
0	our
0	voyage
0	,
0	when
0	,
0	being
0	told
0	that
0	we
0	were
0	never
0	more
0	to
0	return
0	to
0	that
0	island
0	,
0	he
0	lamented
0	the
0	opportunity
0	he
0	had
0	lost
0	when
0	we
0	were
0	here
0	before
0	;

0	and
0	pointing
0	to
0	the
0	sun
0	,
0	seemed
0	to
0	suppose
0	that
0	we
0	should
0	visit
0	that
0	luminary
0	in
0	our
0	course
0	,
0	and
0	that
0	the
0	thunder
0	and
0	lightning
0	of
0	our
0	guns
0	,
0	and
0	that
0	which
0	came
0	from
0	above
0	,
0	were
0	both
0	derived
0	from
0	the
0	same
0	source
0	.

0	Before
0	our
0	departure
0	,
0	an
0	Indian
0	brought
0	on
0	board
0	our
0	ship
0	,
0	a
0	piece
0	of
0	iron
0	,
0	to
0	be
0	fashioned
0	into
0	a
0	podooa
0	,
0	which
0	,
0	upon
0	examination
0	,
0	appeared
0	to
0	be
0	the
0	bolt
0	of
0	some
0	large
0	piece
0	of
0	ship
0	timbers
0	,
0	larger
0	than
0	any
0	that
0	our
0	ships
0	could
0	produce
0	.

0	This
0	excited
0	the
0	curiosity
0	of
0	the
0	officers
0	on
0	board
0	;

0	but
0	no
0	farther
0	discovery
0	could
0	be
0	made
0	,
0	but
0	that
0	it
0	had
0	been
0	taken
0	from
0	a
0	part
0	of
0	a
0	large
0	ship
0	that
0	had
0	been
0	drifted
0	on
0	the
0	coast
0	since
0	our
0	leaving
0	the
0	island
0	in
0	1778
0	.

0	It
0	was
0	of
0	a
0	paler
0	colour
0	than
0	our
0	iron
0	;

0	but
0	of
0	what
0	nation
0	,
0	we
0	were
0	unable
0	to
0	discover
0	.

0	From
0	this
0	harbour
0	we
0	sailed
0	on
0	the
0	9th
0	,
0	and
0	visited
0	the
0	opposite
0	side
0	of
0	the
0	island
0	,
0	where
0	we
0	had
0	likewise
0	passed
0	a
0	part
0	of
0	the
0	former
0	winter
0	.

0	Here
0	we
0	were
0	received
0	with
0	much
0	kindness
0	and
0	hospitality
0	;

0	and
0	here
0	we
0	purchased
0	yams
0	and
0	potatoes
0	for
0	our
0	summer
0	's
0	consumption
0	,
0	which
0	the
0	companies
0	of
0	both
0	ships
0	were
0	glad
0	to
0	accept
0	in
0	exchange
0	for
0	their
0	allowance
0	of
0	bread
0	,
0	that
0	part
0	of
0	their
0	food
0	being
0	both
0	scanty
0	and
0	bad
0	.

0	Besides
0	the
0	natural
0	productions
0	of
0	the
0	country
0	,
0	we
0	purchased
0	in
0	these
0	islands
0	many
0	tons
0	of
0	salt
0	,
0	much
0	of
0	their
0	cordage
0	and
0	cloth
0	,
0	and
0	a
0	great
0	variety
0	of
0	artificial
0	curiosities
0	,
0	such
0	as
0	their
0	weapons
0	of
0	war
0	,
0	their
0	instruments
0	for
0	fishing
0	;

0	their

0	;

0	their

0	working
0	tools
0	,
0	bracelets
0	,
0	ear-jewels
0	,
0	and
0	,
0	in
0	short
0	,
0	almost
0	every
0	thing
0	that
0	was
0	new
0	to
0	us
0	,
0	or
0	which
0	was
0	peculiar
0	to
0	them
0	;

0	among
0	which
0	were

0	In

0	much
0	of

0	they

0	for
0	us
0	to
0	make
0	sail
0	,
0	from
0	whence
0	we
0	concluded
0	that
0	the

0	still
0	distressed
0	them
0	.

0	At

0	with

0	,
0	by
0	which
0	our

0	were

0	In

0	the

0	On

0	very
0	rugged
0	,

0	At

0	,
0	P.

0	we
0	were
0	put

0	finding

0	On

0	it

0	N.
0	E.
0	We
0	kept
0	working
0	to
0	windward
0	,
0	which
0	doubled
0	our

0	;

0	and
0	our
0	concern
0	for
0	our
0	Commodore
0	increased
0	so
0	much
0	the
0	more
0	,
0	as
0	we
0	judged
0	by

0	what
0	must
0	be
0	the

0	of
0	the

0	Amidst

0	our

0	On
0	the
0	28th
0	,
0	we

0	The

0	.

0	We
0	now
0	gave
0	her
0	over
0	for
0	lost
0	.

0	On
0	the
0	29th
0	,
0	we
0	stood
0	in
0	for
0	the
0	land
0	,
0	and
0	at
0	two
0	in
0	the
0	afternoon
0	,
0	we
0	came
0	in
0	sight
0	of
0	the
0	entrance
0	of
0	the
0	bay
0	of
0	Kamshatska
0	,
0	then
0	distant
0	between
0	seven
0	and
0	eight
0	miles
0	to
0	the
0	Southward
0	.

0	We
0	made
0	sail
0	,
0	and
0	stood
0	right
0	in
0	;

0	but
0	finding
0	it
0	froze
0	over
0	,
0	we
0	judged
0	that
0	the
0	Resolution
0	could
0	not
0	possibly
0	be
0	there
0	,
0	and
0	therefore
0	concluded
0	that
0	she
0	must
0	have
0	gone
0	to
0	the
0	bottom
0	.

0	Early
0	next
0	morning
0	,
0	we
0	once
0	more
0	attempted
0	the
0	entrance
0	of
0	the
0	bay
0	,
0	and
0	finding
0	the
0	ice
0	drifted
0	,
0	we
0	conceived
0	hopes
0	that
0	we
0	might
0	be
0	able
0	to
0	force
0	a
0	passage
0	through
0	the
0	loose
0	ice
0	,
0	which
0	,
0	now
0	the
0	weather
0	was
0	fine
0	,
0	did
0	not
0	appear
0	so
0	formidable
0	as
0	before
0	.

0	About
0	noon
0	,
0	a
0	pleasant
0	breeze
0	sprung
0	up
0	,
0	and
0	we
0	directed
0	our
0	course
0	to
0	a
0	flag
0	we
0	saw
0	displayed
0	just
0	within
0	the
0	bay
0	,
0	and
0	happily
0	succeeded
0	,
0	drooping
0	our
0	anchor
0	in
0	twenty
0	fathom
0	water
0	,
0	within
0	less
0	than
0	three
0	leagues
0	of
0	our
0	intended
0	harbour
0	.

0	In
0	about
0	half
0	an
0	hour
0	,
0	while
0	our
0	boats
0	were
0	still
0	looking
0	out
0	for
0	a
0	passage
0	,
0	we
0	observed
0	at
0	a
0	distance
0	two
0	boats
0	making
0	towards
0	us
0	,
0	one
0	of
0	which
0	we
0	knew
0	to
0	belong
0	to
0	the
0	Resolution
0	;

0	the
0	other
0	belonged
0	to
0	the
0	Russians
0	.

0	No
0	joy
0	could
0	exceed
0	that
0	which
0	the
0	certainty
0	of
0	the
0	safety
0	of
0	the
0	Resolution
0	spread
0	through
0	the
0	whole
0	ship
0	's
0	company
0	of
0	the
0	Discovery
0	.

0	She
0	had
0	been
0	in
0	port
0	ever
0	since
0	the
0	27th
0	,
0	and
0	had
0	given
0	us
0	over
0	for
0	lost
0	,
0	never
0	expecting
0	to
0	see
0	us
0	more
0	.

0	She
0	had
0	met
0	with
0	some
0	damage
0	in
0	her
0	sails
0	and
0	rigging
0	;

0	but
0	by
0	her
0	fortunately
0	hitting
0	the
0	harbour
0	,
0	she
0	had
0	escaped
0	much
0	of
0	the
0	distress
0	that
0	we
0	suffered
0	from
0	the
0	severity
0	of
0	the
0	weather
0	.

0	Early
0	on
0	the
0	first
0	of
0	May
0	,
0	we
0	weighed
0	,
0	having
0	the
0	Resolution
0	's
0	boat
0	to
0	direct
0	us
0	.

0	Soon
0	after
0	day-light
0	,
0	we
0	were
0	within
0	the
0	light-house
0	near
0	the
0	entrance
0	of
0	the
0	harbour
0	,
0	but
0	were
0	opposed
0	by
0	a
0	strong
0	tide
0	from
0	the
0	shore
0	,
0	which
0	drifting
0	huge
0	pieces
0	of
0	floating
0	ice
0	against
0	us
0	,
0	made
0	our
0	further
0	progress
0	both
0	dangerous
0	and
0	fatiguing
0	but
0	,
0	having
0	the
0	wind
0	fair
0	,
0	about
0	five
0	in
0	the
0	evening
0	we
0	came
0	to
0	in
0	sight
0	of
0	the
0	town
0	,
0	and
0	soon
0	after
0	dropt
0	anchor
0	near
0	the
0	Resolution
0	.

0	On
0	the
0	2d
0	,
0	the
0	Resolution
0	unmoored
0	,
0	and
0	both
0	ships
0	came
0	to
0	,
0	and
0	moored
0	within
0	a
0	mile
0	of
0	the
0	town
0	,
0	and
0	within
0	a
0	cable
0	's
0	length
0	of
0	the
0	ice
0	,
0	which
0	entirely
0	shut
0	up
0	the
0	head
0	of
0	the
0	bay
0	.

0	—
0	Here
0	we
0	found
0	only
0	one
0	small
0	sloop
0	,
0	about
0	fifty
0	tons
0	,
0	which
0	,
0	as
0	soon
0	as
0	the
0	ice
0	was
0	clear
0	,
0	was
0	bound
0	on
0	a
0	trading
0	voyage
0	to
0	the
0	Northward
0	.

0	—
0	We
0	had
0	no
0	sooner
0	dropt
0	anchor
0	than
0	our
0	boat
0	was
0	ordered
0	out
0	,
0	and
0	our
0	Captain
0	,
0	with
0	several
0	other
0	gentlemen
0	,
0	went
0	to
0	visit
0	Capt.
0	Clerke
0	,
0	and
0	to
0	take
0	his
0	orders
0	for
0	our
0	future
0	proceedings
0	.

0	We
0	found
0	him
0	still
0	growing
0	weaker
0	and
0	weaker
0	;

0	we
0	therefore
0	shortened
0	our
0	stay
0	.

0	On
0	the
0	3d
0	,
0	some
0	of
0	the
0	principal
0	officers
0	and
0	gentlemen
0	went
0	on
0	shore
0	,
0	and
0	were
0	received
0	by
0	a
0	subaltern
0	,
0	who
0	now
0	had
0	the
0	command
0	of
0	the
0	fort
0	,
0	situated
0	close
0	by
0	a
0	little
0	miserable
0	town
0	,
0	called
PLACE-B	St.
PLACE-I	Peter
0	and
0	St.
0	Paul
0	,
0	which
0	,
0	by
0	its
0	appearance
0	,
0	could
0	not
0	be
0	supposed
0	to
0	furnish
0	provisions
0	for
0	the
0	ships
0	crew
0	a
0	single
0	week
0	.

0	We
0	soon
0	learnt
0	that
0	the
0	Governor
0	lived
0	at
0	a
0	town
0	called
PLACE-B	Bolcheritsk
0	,
0	distant
0	about
0	135
0	miles
0	;

0	and
0	that
0	an
0	express
0	had
0	been
0	sent
0	to
0	him
0	on
0	the
0	29th
0	,
0	about
0	noon
0	,
0	in
0	a
0	sledge
0	drawn
0	by
0	dogs
0	,
0	to
0	notify
0	our
0	arrival
0	.

0	The
0	subaltern
0	,
0	in
0	the
0	mean
0	time
0	,
0	shewed
0	us
0	every
0	civility
0	.

0	We
0	found
0	on
0	our
0	landing
0	a
0	sledge
0	drawn
0	by
0	dogs
0	,
0	in
0	readiness
0	to
0	receive
0	our
0	Commander
0	,
0	and
0	to
0	conduct
0	him
0	to
0	the
0	residence
0	of
0	the
0	officer
0	already
0	mentioned
0	,
0	where
0	he
0	found
0	some
0	gentlemen
0	belonging
0	to
0	the
0	Resolution
0	.

0	It
0	was
0	not
0	,
0	however
0	,
0	a
0	little
0	strange
0	,
0	that
0	though
0	we
0	were
0	expected
0	,
0	and
0	that
0	the
0	Empress
0	of
PLACE-B	Russia
0	had
0	given
0	orders
0	to
0	her
0	Governor
0	to
0	furnish
0	us
0	with
0	every
0	accommodation
0	in
0	his
0	power
0	,
0	that
0	not
0	a
0	person
0	was
0	to
0	be
0	found
0	that
0	understood
0	any
0	other
0	language
0	than
0	that
0	of
0	the
0	natives
0	of
0	the
0	place
0	,
0	and
0	of
PLACE-B	Russia
0	;

0	neither
0	of
0	which
0	languages
0	was
0	intelligible
0	to
0	any
0	of
0	us
0	;

0	so
0	that
0	,
0	having
0	no
0	interpreter
0	,
0	every
0	thing
0	was
0	to
0	be
0	conducted
0	by
0	signs
0	.

0	They
0	were
0	hospitably
0	received
0	,
0	and
0	entertained
0	with
0	stewed
0	fish
0	,
0	venison-soups
0	,
0	and
0	other
0	dishes
0	,
0	dressed
0	after
0	the
0	manner
0	of
0	the
0	country
0	;

0	and
0	the
0	officer
0	who
0	now
0	had
0	the
0	command
0	,
0	behaved
0	with
0	an
0	uncommon
0	degree
0	of
0	civility
0	,
0	or
0	,
0	more
0	properly
0	,
0	servility
0	,
0	by
0	paying
0	every
0	attention
0	that
0	his
0	circumstances
0	would
0	admit
0	,
0	to
0	make
0	the
0	Commodore
0	's
0	situation
0	tolerable
0	.

0	He
0	had
0	made
0	him
0	understand
0	,
0	that
0	at
0	the
0	distance
0	of
0	about
0	sixteen
0	wrests
0	,
0	at
0	a
0	town
0	called
0	Paratounka
0	,
0	there
0	lived
0	a
0	priest
0	,
0	who
0	might
0	possibly
0	be
0	able
0	to
0	converse
0	with
0	him
0	;

0	and
0	with
0	that
0	view
0	,
0	he
0	,
0	the
0	very
0	next
0	day
0	,
0	sent
0	an
0	express
0	to
0	invite
0	him
0	to
0	the
0	fort
0	,
0	at
0	the
0	same
0	time
0	intimating
0	that
0	the
0	Governor
0	was
0	a
0	German
0	,
0	who
0	could
0	talk
0	all
0	languages
0	,
0	which
0	accounts
0	for
0	the
0	omission
0	before
0	complained
0	of
0	:
0	and
0	indeed
0	,
0	as
0	it
0	afterwards
0	appeared
0	,
0	we
0	were
0	expected
0	here
0	the
0	preceding
0	summer
0	,
0	and
0	that
0	our
0	arrival
0	was
0	now
0	unlooked
0	for
0	.

0	On
0	board
0	,
0	the
0	carpenters
0	were
0	busy
0	in
0	stripping
0	the
0	ships
0	bows
0	,
0	where
0	they
0	found
0	the
0	leak
0	of
0	the
0	Resolution
0	to
0	have
0	been
0	chiefly
0	seated
0	.

0	The
0	larboard
0	bow
0	had
0	been
0	stript
0	of
0	its
0	sheathing
0	,
0	and
0	the
0	oakum
0	had
0	been
0	washed
0	out
0	.

0	The
0	sailors
0	were
0	employed
0	in
0	getting
0	the
0	sick
0	on
0	shore
0	,
0	with
0	every
0	part
0	of
0	the
0	ships
0	stores
0	that
0	stood
0	in
0	need
0	of
0	revisal
0	;

0	and
0	though
0	the
0	weather
0	continued
0	piercing
0	cold
0	,
0	no
0	time
0	was
0	lost
0	in
0	forwarding
0	the
0	repairs
0	.

0	On
0	the
0	4th
0	,
0	one
0	of
0	our
0	boats
0	,
0	in
0	putting
0	the
0	astronomer
0	's
0	assistant
0	on
0	shore
0	at
0	the
0	influx
0	of
0	the
0	tide
0	,
0	was
0	suddenly
0	encircled
0	by
0	the
0	floating
0	ice
0	,
0	in
0	such
0	a
0	manner
0	as
0	not
0	to
0	be
0	able
0	to
0	move
0	one
0	way
0	or
0	the
0	other
0	;

0	another
0	boat
0	,
0	sent
0	to
0	her
0	relief
0	,
0	was
0	soon
0	enclosed
0	in
0	the
0	same
0	manner
0	,
0	and
0	till
0	Page
0	325
0	the
0	return
0	of
0	the
0	tide
0	,
0	both
0	were
0	forced
0	to
0	remain
0	in
0	that
0	deplorable
0	situation
0	,
0	not
0	a
0	person
0	on

0	daring
0	to
0	trust
0	himself
0	among
0	the
0	floating
0	ice
0	,
0	to
0	go
0	to
0	their
0	assistance
0	.

0	About
0	twelve
0	at
0	night
0	they
0	were
0	released
0	,
0	and
0	the
0	icey
0	prisoners
0	returned
0	on
0	board
0	,
0	almost
0	perished
0	with
0	cold
0	.

0	A
0	still
0	worse
0	accident
0	happened
0	to
0	Lieut
0	.

0	.

0	Providentially

0	having

0	in

0	,
0	instantly

0	and
0	laying

0	across
0	two

0	of

0	On

0	,
0	six

0	,

0	,
0	no

0	was
0	no

0	By
0	this
0	time
0	dinner
0	was
0	ready
0	,
0	and
0	the

0	After

0	The

0	heard

0	With

0	Some

0	,

0	,
0	but
0	the

0	which
0	,
0	however
0	,
0	not

0	and
0	large

0	The

0	leagues
0	.

0	We
0	steered
0	all
0	night
0	W.
0	by
0	N.
0	and
0	next
0	morning
0	found
0	ourselves
0	almost
0	surrounded
0	with
0	fields
0	of
0	ice
0	drifting
0	to
0	the
0	southward
0	.

0	At
0	twelve
0	o
0	'clock
0	we
0	hauled
0	our
0	wind
0	to
0	the
0	southward
0	,
0	and
0	,
0	by
0	the
0	alertness
0	of
0	our
0	seamen
0	,
0	we
0	passed
0	them
0	with
0	very
0	little
0	damage
0	.

0	On
0	the
0	22d
0	,
0	about
0	two
0	A
0	M.
0	we
0	again
0	stood
0	S.
0	S.
0	W.
0	but
0	at
0	six
0	saw
0	the
0	ice
0	all
0	round
0	us
0	from
0	S.
0	E.
0	to
0	N.
0	W.
0	hauled
0	our
0	wind
0	upon
0	our
0	larboard
0	tack
0	,
0	and
0	stood
0	S.
0	S.
0	E.
0	We
0	were
0	all
0	this
0	day
0	luffing
0	up
0	and
0	bearing
0	away
0	to
0	avoid
0	the
0	ice
0	,
0	which
0	was
0	on
0	every
0	side
0	in
0	sight
0	,
0	in
0	many
0	frightful
0	shapes
0	.

0	On
0	the
0	morning
0	of
0	the
0	23d
0	it
0	came
0	on
0	to
0	blow
0	very
0	hard
0	,
0	and
0	,
0	before
0	noon
0	,
0	we
0	found
0	ourselves
0	closely
0	blocked
0	up
0	in
0	the
0	ice
0	,
0	and
0	could
0	see
0	it
0	all
0	round
0	us
0	in
0	a
0	solid
0	body
0	,
0	to
0	a
0	great
0	distance
0	.

0	At
0	the
0	same
0	time
0	we
0	saw
0	the
0	Resolution
0	bearing
0	N.
0	E.
0	½
0	E.
0	some
0	miles
0	off
0	,
0	which
0	was
0	the
0	last
0	sight
0	we
0	had
0	of
0	her
0	during
0	the
0	whole
0	day
0	.

0	In
0	this
0	horrid
0	situation
0	we
0	handed
0	all
0	our
0	sails
0	,
0	unbent
0	our
0	fore-top-sail
0	,
0	and
0	moored
0	ship
0	with
0	both
0	our
0	ice
0	anchors
0	,
0	one
0	to
0	each
0	bow
0	.

0	We
0	now
0	began
0	to
0	reflect
0	on
0	our
0	condition
0	;

0	the
0	winter
0	drawing
0	on
0	apace
0	;

0	our
0	provisions
0	short
0	,
0	and
0	what
0	we
0	had
0	but
0	very
0	indifferent
0	,
0	and
0	no
0	relief
0	to
0	be
0	expected
0	;

0	our
0	people
0	's
0	spirits
0	began
0	to
0	sink
0	,
0	and
0	it
0	was
0	with
0	difficulty
0	that
0	they
0	were
0	persuaded
0	to
0	exert
0	themselves
0	for
0	their
0	own
0	deliverance
0	.

0	Fortunately
0	for
0	us
0	,
0	we
0	had
0	,
0	in
0	the
0	evening
0	,
0	a
0	shift
0	of
0	wind
0	from
0	W.
0	N.
0	W.
0	with
0	a
0	steady
0	breeze
0	,
0	when
0	our
0	Captain
0	,
0	looking
0	over
0	our
0	starboard
0	quarter
0	,
0	discerned
0	the
0	ice
0	to
0	the
0	southward
0	,
0	seemingly
0	to
0	leave
0	the
0	ship
0	,
0	and
0	soon
0	heard
0	a
0	crash
0	,
0	as
0	if
0	a
0	thousand
0	rocks
0	had
0	been
0	rent
0	from
0	their
0	foundations
0	;

0	which
0	we
0	afterwards
0	perceived
0	to
0	be
0	the
0	parting
0	of
0	the
0	ice
0	in
0	different
0	directions
0	,
0	and
0	soon
0	after
0	found
0	ourselves
0	released
0	.

0	We
0	instantly
0	got
0	up
0	our
0	ice-anchors
0	,
0	and
0	shaped
0	our
0	course
0	from
0	S.
0	E.
0	to
0	E.
0	S.
0	E.
0	but
0	were
0	frequently
0	stopped
0	by
0	large
0	pieces
0	,
0	which
0	carried
0	away
0	great
0	part
0	of
0	our
0	sheathing
0	forward
0	,
0	and
0	damaged
0	our
0	stern
0	,
0	so
0	that
0	the
0	ship
0	made
0	water
0	at
0	the
0	rate
0	of
0	three
0	inches
0	and
0	a
0	half
0	an
0	hour
0	;

0	and
0	at
0	the
0	same
0	time
0	had
0	37
0	inches
0	in
0	her
0	well
0	.

0	On
0	the
0	24th
0	we
0	continued
0	our
0	course
0	E.
0	S.
0	E.
0	and
0	came
0	in
0	fight
0	of
0	the
0	Resolution
0	,
0	which
0	had
0	likewise
0	received
0	much
0	damage
0	about
0	her
0	bows
0	.

0	We
0	were
0	now
0	clear
0	of
0	the
0	ice
0	,
0	and
0	,
0	till
0	three
0	in
0	the
0	afternoon
0	,
0	sailed
0	in
0	company
0	,
0	till
0	we
0	came
0	up
0	with
0	a
0	solid
0	body
0	of
0	ice
0	,
0	on
0	which
0	we
0	saw
0	a
0	number
0	of
0	amphibious
0	animals
0	,
0	some
0	of
0	them
0	very
0	large
0	.

0	We
0	instantly
0	got
0	out
0	and
0	manned
0	our
0	boats
0	,
0	and
0	in
0	three
0	hours
0	returned
0	with
0	eleven
0	of
0	the
0	largest
0	,
0	about
0	which
0	all
0	hands
0	were
0	employed
0	the
0	next
0	day
0	in
0	skinning
0	and
0	cutting
0	them
0	up
0	for
0	blubber
0	.

0	On
0	the
0	25th
0	we
0	passed
0	several
0	fields
0	of
0	ice
0	.

0	We
0	steered
0	N.
0	E.
0	one-half
0	E.
0	and
0	at
0	noon
0	was
0	at
0	the
0	extreme
0	of
0	the
0	easternmost
0	land
0	in
0	sight
0	,
0	being
0	then
0	in
0	lat
0	.

0	69.12.
0	and
0	,
0	by
0	lunar
0	observation
0	,
0	in
0	long
0	.

0	187.16
0	.

0	East
0	of
PLACE-B	London
0	.

0	It
0	was
0	now
0	excessive
0	cold
0	;

0	the
0	snow
0	froze
0	as
0	it
0	fell
0	.

0	The
0	blocks
0	were
0	choaked
0	up
0	,
0	and
0	the
0	ropes
0	increased
0	by
0	the
0	frost
0	to
0	double
0	their
0	real
0	size
0	.

0	In
0	this
0	condition
0	it
0	is
0	easy
0	to
0	conceive
0	,
0	the
0	fatigues
0	to
0	which
0	the
0	poor
0	sailors
0	were
0	exposed
0	;

0	yet
0	by
0	a
0	little
0	encouragement
0	,
0	increasing
0	their
0	allowance
0	of
0	grog
0	,
0	and
0	giving
0	them
0	plenty
0	of
0	provisions
0	,
0	they
0	continued
0	their
0	labour
0	with
0	cheerfulness
0	and
0	astonishing
0	perseverance
0	.

0	On
0	the
0	27th
0	we
0	found
0	ourselves
0	involved
0	again
0	among
0	the
0	loose
0	ice
0	,
0	some
0	of
0	which
0	it
0	was
0	out
0	of
0	our
0	power
0	to
0	escape
0	;

0	and
0	the
0	leak
0	still
0	continuing
0	rather
0	to
0	increase
0	than
0	abate
0	,
0	our
0	Captain
0	,
0	with
PERSON-B	Mr.
PERSON-I	Bailey
0	the

0	,
0	and
PERSON-B	Mr.
PERSON-I	Burney
0	,
0	our
0	first
0	Lieutenant
0	,
0	went
0	on
0	board
0	the
0	Resolution
0	,
0	to
0	report
0	our
0	situation
0	to
0	the

0	,
0	whom
0	they
0	found
0	so
0	ill
0	as

0	of
0	recovery
0	.

0	Upon
0	calling
0	a
0	council
0	of
0	officers
0	,
0	it
0	was
0	unanimously
0	agreed
0	,
0	that
0	we
0	should
0	proceed
0	as
0	fast
0	as
0	possible
0	to
0	some
0	port
0	,
0	where
0	we
0	might
0	repair
0	our

0	,
0	and
0	Kamshatska
0	was
0	appointed
0	our

0	of

0	.

0	We
0	were

0	On
0	the
0	28th
0	,
0	at
0	two
0	in
0	the
0	morning
0	we
0	came
0	in
0	sight
0	of
0	the
0	Asiatic
0	shore
0	,
0	very
0	high
0	and

0	,
0	distance
0	about
0	7

0	,
0	we
0	made
0	sail
0	and
0	stood
0	to
0	the

0	.

0	About
0	noon
0	we

0	At

0	we

0	,
0	and
0	sea-parrots

0	could

0	On

0	188.27.
0	but
0	no
0	land

0	On
0	the
0	30th
0	we
0	steered

0	noon
0	to
0	the
0	S.
0	E.
0	with
0	a
0	steady
0	breeze
0	,
0	and
0	came

0	right

0	distant
0	about

0	The

0	when
0	the

0	clearing

0	to
0	which
0	we
0	bore
0	away
0	,

0	This

0	we
0	called
0	North
0	streight
0	,
0	the

0	we
0	found
0	the

0	setting

0	,
0	made
0	our
0	passage
0	not

0	difficult
0	but
0	dangerous
0	.

0	We
0	shaped
0	our

0	S.
0	S.
0	W.
0	and
0	continued
0	the

0	On

0	called

0	Tuskan-noss
0	,
0	and

0	To

0	Nothing

0	the

0	at
0	the

0	again

0	.

0	It
0	was
0	then
0	at
0	a
0	very
0	great
0	distance
0	,
0	and
0	upon
0	our
0	starboard
0	bow
0	,
0	but
0	before

0	we
0	were

0	On

0	our

0	with
0	the

0	of
0	our
0	Commodore
0	.

0	We
0	were
0	then
0	within
0	sight
0	of
0	the
0	flag
0	,
0	at
0	the
0	mouth
0	of

0	of
0	which

0	already
0	been
0	made
0	;

0	and
0	the
0	wind
0	being
0	favourable
0	,
0	we
0	continued
0	our
0	course
0	for
0	the
0	entrance
0	of
0	the
0	harbour
0	,
0	which

0	lat.
0	at

0	.

0	On
0	the
0	23d
0	a
0	little
0	before
0	midnight
0	,
0	we
0	came
0	to
0	anchor
0	within
0	the
0	light-house
0	.

0	On
0	the
0	24th
0	our
0	Captain
0	,
0	being
0	now
0	Commodore
0	,
0	made
0	the
0	signal
0	to
0	get
0	under
0	way
0	by
0	towing
0	;

0	all
0	the
0	boats
0	were
0	accordingly
0	got
0	out
0	,
0	and
0	the
0	Commodore
0	went
0	on
0	board
0	the
0	Resolution
0	,
0	where
0	it
0	was
0	resolved
0	,
0	for
0	the
0	greater
0	convenience
0	of
0	repairing
0	the
0	ships
0	,
0	and
0	for
0	erecting
0	the
0	tents
0	and
0	forge
0	,
0	to
0	go
0	within
0	the
0	upper
0	harbour
0	.

0	And
0	about
0	four
0	in
0	the
0	afternoon
0	both
0	ships
0	came
0	to
0	,
0	and
0	were
0	moored
0	in
0	three
0	fathom
0	and
0	a
0	half
0	water
0	,
0	muddy
0	bottom
0	.

0	The
0	old
0	serjeant
0	,
0	who
0	still
0	commanded
0	at
0	the
0	fort
0	,
0	came
0	with
0	a
0	present
0	of
0	berries
0	for
0	Capt.
0	Clerke
0	.

0	He
0	seemed
0	much
0	affected
0	when
0	he
0	was
0	shewn
0	his
0	coffin
0	,
0	and
0	was
0	told
0	it
0	was
0	his
0	particular
0	desire
0	to
0	be
0	buried
0	on
0	shore
0	.

0	Early
0	next
0	morning
0	the
0	tents
0	were
0	erected
0	,
0	and
0	the
0	sick
0	were
0	put
0	on
0	shore
0	.

0	From
0	the
0	time
0	we
0	set
0	sail
0	out
0	of
0	this
0	bay
0	in
0	June
0	,
0	till
0	the
0	present
0	day
0	,
0	we
0	had
0	been
0	in
0	no
0	harbour
0	to
0	refit
0	;

0	and
0	had
0	been
0	driven
0	from
0	island
0	to
0	island
0	among
0	the
0	ice
0	,
0	till
0	our
0	ships
0	had
0	in
0	a
0	manner
0	lost
0	their
0	sheathing
0	,
0	and
0	were
0	otherwise
0	in
0	a
0	shattered
0	condition
0	;

0	we
0	were
0	therefore
0	happy
0	in
0	arriving
0	safe
0	.

0	August
0	25th
0	,
0	an
0	express
0	was
0	sent
0	to
PLACE-B	Bolcheritsk
0	,
0	to
0	acquaint
0	the
0	new
0	governor
0	,
0	Capt.
0	Shmaleff
0	,
0	with
0	our

0	,
0	and
0	with
0	the
0	death
0	of
0	our
0	late
0	Commander
0	,
0	at
0	the
0	same
0	time
0	requesting
0	a
0	fresh
0	supply
0	of
0	cattle
0	.

0	Another
0	express
0	was
0	sent
0	to
0	Paratounka
0	,
0	to
0	desire
0	the
0	attendance
0	of
0	the
0	priest
0	,
0	in
0	order
0	to
0	consult
0	with
0	him
0	concerning
0	the
0	interment
0	of
0	Capt.
0	Clerke
0	,
0	whose
0	desire
0	was
0	,
0	to
0	be
0	buried
0	in
0	his
0	church
0	.

0	While
0	we
0	were
0	waiting
0	the
0	issue
0	of
0	these
0	messages
0	,
0	the
0	several
0	promotions
0	took
0	place
0	that
0	followed
0	in
0	consequence
0	of
0	the
0	Commander
0	's
0	death
0	.

PERSON-B	Mr.
PERSON-I	Gore
0	went
0	on
0	board
0	the
0	Resolution
0	,
0	and
PERSON-B	Mr.
PERSON-I	King
0	,
0	first
0	Lieut
0	.

0	of
0	the
0	Resolution
0	,
0	took
0	the
0	command
0	of
0	the
0	Discovery
0	.

0	Other
0	promotions
0	took
0	place
0	,
0	which
0	the
0	reader
0	will
0	remark
0	by
0	the
0	sequel
0	.

0	The
0	first
0	care
0	of
0	the
0	commanders
0	of
0	both
0	ships
0	was
0	to
0	provide
0	for
0	the
0	recovery
0	of
0	the
0	sick
0	,
0	and
0	the
0	repairs
0	of
0	the
0	ships
0	;

0	and
0	for
0	that
0	purpose
0	a
0	house
0	was
0	procured
0	for
0	the
0	reception
0	of
0	the
0	former
0	,
0	and
0	a
0	contrivance
0	made
0	for
0	having
0	the
0	latter
0	dry
0	.

0	The
0	weather
0	being
0	now
0	temperate
0	and
0	the
0	country
0	delightful
0	,
0	the
0	officers
0	and
0	gentlemen
0	chose
0	to
0	sleep
0	in
0	their
0	marquees
0	on
0	shore
0	.

0	It
0	was
0	however
0	thought
0	expedient
0	to
0	shew
0	every
0	mark
0	of
0	respect
0	to
0	the
0	Russian
0	officers
0	,
0	who
0	,
0	though
0	not
0	of
0	the
0	first
0	rank
0	,
0	were
0	notwithstanding
0	the
0	only
0	people
0	with
0	whom
0	we
0	had
0	any
0	concern
0	,
0	or
0	with
0	whom
0	we
0	could
0	have
0	any
0	communication
0	;

0	they
0	were
0	therefore
0	frequently
0	invited
0	to
0	dinner
0	,
0	and
0	they
0	often
0	attended
0	.

0	On
0	the
0	26th
0	the
0	priest
0	arrived
0	,
0	when
PERSON-B	Capt.
PERSON-I	Gore
0	acquainted
0	him
0	with
0	the
0	death
0	of
0	our
0	commander
0	,
0	and
0	of
0	his
0	desire
0	to
0	be
0	buried
0	in
0	his
0	church
0	.

0	The
0	good
0	old
0	gentleman
0	seemed
0	much
0	concerned
0	,
0	but
0	started
0	several
0	difficulties
0	,
0	and
0	appeared
0	very
0	unwilling
0	to
0	comply
0	with
0	the
0	dying
0	request
0	of
0	the
0	deceased
0	.

0	He
0	urged
0	several
0	reasons
0	to
0	shew
0	the
0	impropriety
0	of
0	it
0	;

0	those
0	of
0	most
0	weight
0	were
0	,
0	that
0	the
0	church
0	was
0	soon
0	to
0	be
0	pulled
0	down
0	;

0	that
0	it
0	was
0	every
0	winter
0	three
0	feet
0	deep
0	in
0	water
0	;

0	and
0	that
0	in
0	a
0	few
0	years
0	no
0	vestige
0	of
0	it
0	would
0	remain
0	,
0	as
0	the
0	new
0	church
0	was
0	to
0	be
0	erected
0	near
0	the
0	town
0	of
0	Awatska
0	,
0	upon
0	a
0	drier
0	and
0	more
0	convenient
0	spot
0	.

0	He
0	therefore
0	advised
0	the
0	remains
0	of
0	the
0	Commander
0	to
0	be
0	deposited
0	at
0	the
0	foot
0	of
0	a
0	tree
0	,
0	the
0	scite
0	of
0	which
0	was
0	to
0	be
0	included
0	in
0	the
0	body
0	of
0	the
0	new
0	church
0	,
0	where
0	the
0	Captain
0	's
0	bones
0	might
0	probably
0	rest
0	for
0	ages
0	undisturbed
0	.

0	These
0	reasons
0	,
0	whether
0	real
0	or
0	fictitious
0	,
0	the
0	officers
0	who
0	had
0	charge
0	of
0	the
0	funeral
0	could
0	not
0	disprove
0	,
0	and
0	therefore
0	people
0	were
0	sent
0	to
0	dig
0	the
0	grave
0	where
0	the
0	priest
0	should
0	direct
0	.

0	All
0	hands
0	were
0	now
0	busy
0	at
0	work
0	on
0	their
0	different
0	employments
0	.

0	The
0	Discovery
0	,
0	on
0	being
0	examined
0	,
0	was
0	found
0	to
0	be
0	in
0	a
0	most
0	wretched
0	condition
0	;

0	many
0	of
0	her
0	timbers
0	beneath
0	the
0	wale
0	shaken
0	,
0	and
0	some
0	of
0	her
0	planks
0	rotten
0	,
0	and
0	for
0	want
0	of
0	others
0	to
0	supply
0	their
0	places
0	,
0	were
0	forced
0	to
0	be
0	shifted
0	.

0	The
0	29th
0	was
0	appointed
0	for
0	the
0	interment
0	;

0	and
0	to
0	make
0	the
0	funeral
0	the
0	more
0	solemn
0	,
0	every
0	officer
0	was
0	desired
0	to
0	appear
0	in
0	his
0	uniform
0	;

0	the
0	marines
0	to
0	be
0	drawn
0	up
0	under
0	arms
0	,
0	and
0	the
0	common
0	men
0	to
0	be
0	dressed
0	as
0	nearly
0	alike
0	as
0	possible
0	,
0	in
0	order
0	to
0	attend
0	the
0	corpse
0	from
0	the
0	water-side
0	to
0	the
0	grave
0	.

0	All
0	this
0	was
0	readily
0	complied
0	with
0	,
0	and
0	the
0	procession
0	began
0	about
0	ten
0	in
0	the
0	morning
0	,
0	when
0	minute
0	guns
0	from
0	the
0	ships
0	were
0	fired
0	,
0	and

0	It

0	desire

0	On

0	The

0	This

0	too
0	much

0	be
0	slighted
0	.

0	Accordingly
0	,
0	On
0	the
0	3d
0	the
0	pinnaces
0	and
0	beats
0	from
0	both

0	/
0	&gt;
0	The

0	She

0	a

0	,
0	when
0	she
0	dropt
0	anchor
0	,
0	and
0	was
0	answered
0	by
0	a
0	volley
0	from
0	the

0	,
0	which
0	consisted

0	a

0	twenty-five
0	soldiers
0	.

0	She
0	was
0	no
0	sooner
0	moored

0	than
0	we
0	received
0	a

0	or
0	Sub-Lieutenant
0	,
0	who
0	was
0	to

0	He
0	was
0	introduced
0	to
0	the

0	,
0	to
0	whom
0	he
0	delivered
0	the

0	of

0	;

0	among

0	As

0	and
0	delivered

0	took

PLACE-B	Bolcheritsk
0	;

0	and
0	the
0	ships
0	being
0	lightened
0	afore
0	,
0	and
0	their
0	bows
0	heaved
0	up
0	dry
0	,
0	so
0	that
0	the
0	carpenters
0	could
0	get
0	at
0	the
0	leaks
0	,
0	the
0	Captains
0	and
0	principal
0	officers
0	finding
0	little
0	else
0	to
0	amuse
0	them
0	,
0	made
0	a
0	party
0	to
0	scour
0	the
0	woods
0	for
0	game
0	;

0	but
0	this
0	proved
0	the
0	worst
0	season
0	in
0	the
0	year
0	for
0	hunting
0	.

0	They
0	had
0	been
0	told
0	,
0	that
0	rein-deer
0	,
0	wolves
0	,
0	foxes
0	,
0	beavers
0	,

0	every
0	where
0	abounded
0	in
0	the
0	forests
0	of
0	this
0	country
0	;

0	and
0	they
0	had
0	promised
0	themselves
0	great
0	sport
0	in
0	pursuing
0	them
0	;

0	but
0	after
0	staying
0	out
0	full
0	two
0	days
0	and
0	nights
0	,
0	during
0	which
0	time
0	they
0	had
0	been
0	exposed
0	to
0	several
0	severe
0	storms
0	,
0	they
0	returned
0	much
0	fatigued
0	,
0	without
0	having
0	been
0	able
0	to
0	kill
0	a
0	single
0	creature
0	.

0	The
0	parties
0	who
0	had
0	been
0	sent
0	out
0	to
0	wood
0	and
0	water
0	had
0	succeeded
0	much
0	better
0	.

0	As
0	soon
0	as
0	the
0	ships
0	were
0	ready
0	to
0	launch
0	,
0	they
0	were
0	ready
0	to
0	compleat
0	the
0	hold
0	.

0	In
0	short
0	,
0	the
0	utmost
0	dispatch
0	was
0	made
0	to
0	hasten
0	our
0	departure
0	,
0	so
0	that
0	by
0	the
0	latter
0	end
0	of
0	September
0	we
0	were
0	in
0	readiness
0	to
0	put
0	to
0	sea
0	.

0	The
0	cattle
0	with
0	which
0	we
0	were
0	now
0	supplied
0	,
0	one
0	would
0	have
0	thought
0	,
0	had
0	dropt
0	from
0	another
0	region
0	,
0	It
0	is
0	among
0	the
0	wonders
0	of
0	nature
0	,
0	with
0	what
0	celerity
0	every
0	vegetable
0	and
0	every
0	animal
0	changes
0	its
0	appearance
0	in
0	this
0	climate
0	.

0	On
0	the
0	12th
0	of
0	June
0	,
0	when
0	we
0	left
0	the
0	harbour
0	of
0	Kamshatska
0	,
0	the
0	spring
0	had
0	but
0	just
0	begun
0	to
0	announce
0	the
0	approach
0	of
0	summer
0	,
0	by
0	the
0	budding
0	of
0	the
0	trees
0	,
0	and
0	the
0	springing
0	of
0	the
0	grass
0	;

0	but
0	now
0	,
0	on
0	our
0	return
0	,
0	it
0	was
0	matter
0	of
0	surprize
0	to
0	find
0	the
0	fruits
0	ripe
0	,
0	and
0	the
0	harvest
0	in
0	full
0	perfection
0	.

0	The
0	cattle
0	were
0	mere
0	skin
0	and
0	bone
0	,
0	which
0	we
0	were
0	glad
0	to
0	accept
0	at
0	first
0	coming
0	;

0	but
0	those
0	that
0	were
0	now
0	sent
0	us
0	were
0	fine
0	and
0	fat
0	,
0	and
0	would
0	have
0	made
0	no
0	bad
0	figure

0	The

0	the

PERSON-B	Mr.
PERSON-I	Nelson
0	reaped
0	a
0	rich
0	harvest
0	of
0	rare
0	plants
0	,
0	and
0	had
0	the
0	additional
0	pleasure
0	of
0	gathering
0	them
0	in
0	their
0	most
0	exalted
0	state
0	.

0	In
0	this
0	interval
0	of
0	idle
0	time
0	,
0	between
0	compleating
0	our
0	repairs
0	and
0	clearing
0	the
0	harbour
0	,
0	we
0	had
0	leisure
0	to
0	take
0	a
0	view
0	of
0	the
0	town
0	near
0	the
0	shore
0	,
0	where
0	we
0	first
0	moored
0	,
0	and
0	that
0	of
PLACE-I	Paratounka
0	,
0	where
0	the
0	priest
0	lived
0	,
0	and
0	where
0	the
0	church
0	was
0	situated
0	.

0	These
0	towns
0	have
0	received
0	some
0	improvement
0	since
0	they
0	became
0	subject
0	to
0	the
0	Rus
0	+
0	sians
0	,
0	but
0	are
0	still
0	most
0	wretched
0	dwellings
0	.

0	The
0	houses
0	are
0	built
0	(
0	if
0	we
0	may
0	call
0	that
0	building
0	,
0	which
0	is
0	half
0	dug
0	out
0	of

0	/

0	summer
0	,
0	and
0	the
0	other
0	for
0	their
0	winter
0	residence
0	.

0	Their
0	winter
0	habitation
0	is
0	made
0	by
0	digging
0	a
0	square
0	hole
0	in
0	the
0	earth
0	,
0	about
0	five
0	or
0	six
0	feet
0	deep
0	,
0	the
0	length
0	and
0	breadth
0	being
0	proportioned
0	to
0	the
0	number
0	of
0	people
0	that
0	are
0	to
0	live
0	in
0	it
0	.

0	At
0	each
0	corner
0	of
0	this
0	square
0	hole
0	they
0	set
0	up
0	a
0	thick
0	post
0	,
0	and
0	in
0	the
0	intermediate
0	space
0	between
0	these
0	corner
0	posts
0	,
0	they
0	place
0	other
0	posts
0	at
0	certain
0	distances
0	,
0	and
0	over
0	these
0	they
0	lay
0	balks
0	,
0	fastening
0	them
0	together
0	with
0	strong
0	cords
0	,
0	which
0	they
0	make
0	of
0	nettles
0	prepared
0	in
0	the
0	manner
0	of
0	hemp
0	.

0	Across
0	these
0	they
0	place
0	other
0	balks
0	,
0	in
0	the
0	manner
0	of
0	a
0	bridge
0	,
0	then
0	cover
0	the
0	whole
0	with
0	thatch
0	,
0	leaving
0	a
0	square
0	opening
0	in
0	the
0	middle
0	,
0	which
0	serves
0	at
0	once
0	for
0	door
0	,
0	window
0	,
0	and
0	chimney
0	.

0	On
0	one
0	side
0	of
0	this
0	square
0	is
0	their
0	fire-place
0	,
0	and
0	on
0	the
0	opposite
0	side
0	is
0	ranged
0	their
0	kitchen-furniture
0	.

0	On
0	the
0	two
0	other
0	sides
0	are
0	a
0	kind
0	of
0	broad
0	benches
0	made
0	with
0	earth
0	,
0	on
0	which
0	each
0	family
0	lie
0	,
0	and
0	in
0	one
0	of
0	these
0	huts
0	or
0	houses
0	there
0	live
0	several
0	families
0	.

0	To
0	enter
0	these
0	huts
0	by
0	the
0	only
0	opening
0	at
0	top
0	,
0	they
0	use
0	a
0	ladder
0	,
0	not
0	made
0	with
0	rounds
0	between
0	two
0	sides
0	,
0	like
0	ours
0	,
0	but
0	consisting
0	only
0	of
0	narrow
0	slips
0	of
0	wood
0	fastened
0	to
0	a
0	plank
0	.

0	This
0	ladder
0	the
0	women
0	mount
0	with
0	great
0	agility
0	,
0	with
0	children
0	at
0	their
0	backs
0	;

0	and
0	though
0	the
0	smoke
0	would
0	blind
0	and
0	suffocate
0	those
0	who
0	are
0	not
0	used
0	to
0	it
0	,
0	yet
0	the
0	Kamshatskadales
0	find
0	no
0	inconvenience
0	from
0	it
0	.

0	Their
0	summer
0	huts
0	,
0	called
0	balagans
0	,
0	are
0	made
0	by
0	fixing
0	up
0	posts
0	about
0	fourteen
0	feet
0	above
0	ground
0	,
0	and
0	laying
0	balks
0	over
0	them
0	as
0	before
0	.

0	On
0	these
0	they
0	make
0	a
0	floor
0	,
0	and
0	then
0	raise
0	a
0	roof
0	,
0	which
0	they
0	thatch
0	with
0	grass
0	.

0	To
0	these
0	balagans
0	they
0	have
0	two
0	doors
0	,
0	which
0	they
0	ascend
0	by
0	the
0	same
0	kind
0	of
0	ladder
0	.

0	In
0	the
0	winter
0	they
0	use
0	the
0	balagans
0	for
0	magazines
0	,
0	the
0	thatch
0	secures
0	what
0	they
0	lay
0	up
0	in
0	them
0	from
0	rain
0	,
0	and
0	by
0	taking
0	away
0	the
0	ladder
0	,
0	it
0	becomes
0	inaccessible
0	to
0	wild
0	beasts
0	and
0	vermin
0	.

0	It
0	being
0	summer
0	,
0	we
0	had
0	no
0	access
0	to
0	their
0	winter
0	dwellings
0	,
0	which
0	were
0	all
0	shut
0	up
0	,
0	and
0	they
0	were
0	not
0	over
0	fond
0	of
0	exposing
0	their
0	poverty
0	;

0	for
0	though
0	they
0	have
0	little
0	to
0	boast
0	of
0	,
0	they
0	are
0	not
0	without
0	pride
0	.

0	The
0	whole
0	furniture
0	of
0	the
0	commonality
0	consists
0	of
0	dishes
0	,
0	bowls
0	,
0	troughs
0	,
0	and
0	cans
0	;

0	their
0	cans
0	are
0	made
0	of
0	birch
0	bark
0	,
0	their
0	other
0	utensils
0	of
0	wood
0	,
0	which
0	till
0	the
0	Russians
0	introduced
0	iron
0	among
0	them
0	,
0	they
0	hollowed
0	with
0	instruments
0	made
0	of
0	stone
0	or
0	bone
0	;

0	but
0	with
0	these
0	tools
0	their
0	work
0	was
0	tedious
0	and
0	difficult
0	.

0	In
0	these
0	bowls
0	they
0	dress
0	their
0	food
0	,
0	though
0	,
0	being
0	wood
0	,
0	they
0	will
0	not
0	bear
0	the
0	fire
0	.

0	In
0	the
0	winter
0	the
0	men
0	are
0	employed
0	in
0	hunting
0	,
0	making
0	sledges
0	,
0	and
0	fetching
0	wood
0	;

0	and
0	the
0	women
0	in
0	weaving
0	nets
0	,
0	and
0	spinning
0	thread
0	.

0	In
0	the
0	spring
0	the
0	rivers
0	begin
0	to
0	thaw
0	,
0	and
0	the
0	fish
0	that
0	wintered
0	in
0	them
0	to
0	go
0	towards
0	the
0	sea
0	;

0	the
0	men
0	therefore
0	in
0	this
0	season
0	are
0	busied
0	in
0	fishing
0	,
0	and
0	the
0	women
0	in
0	curing
0	what
0	they
0	catch
0	.

0	They
0	chiefly
0	catch
0	the
0	salmon
0	,
0	which
0	are
0	very
0	plenty
0	and
0	very
0	delicious
0	,
0	by
0	spearing
0	,
0	at
0	which
0	they
0	are
0	as
0	aukward
0	as
0	at
0	shooting
0	.

0	In
0	the
0	summer
0	the
0	men
0	build
0	both
0	their
0	winter
0	and
0	summer
0	huts
0	,
0	train
0	their
0	dogs
0	,
0	and
0	make
0	their
0	houshold
0	utensils
0	and
0	warlike
0	instruments
0	;

0	but
0	the
0	women
0	make
0	all
0	the
0	clothing
0	,
0	even
0	to
0	the
0	shoes
0	.

0	Their
0	clothes
0	,
0	for
0	the
0	most
0	part
0	,
0	are
0	made
0	of
0	the
0	skins
0	of
0	land
0	and
0	sea-animals
0	,
0	particularly
0	deer
0	,
0	dogs
0	,
0	and
0	seals
0	;

0	but
0	sometimes
0	they
0	use
0	the
0	skins
0	of
0	birds
0	,
0	and
0	frequently
0	those
0	of
0	different
0	animals
0	in
0	the
0	same
0	garments
0	.

0	They
0	commonly
0	wear
0	two
0	coats
0	;

0	the
0	under
0	one
0	with
0	the
0	hair
0	inwards
0	,
0	and
0	the
0	upper
0	one
0	with
0	the
0	hair
0	outwards
0	.

0	The
0	women
0	have
0	besides
0	,
0	an
0	under
0	garment
0	,
0	not
0	unlike
0	Dutch
0	trowsers
0	,
0	divided
0	and
0	drawn
0	round
0	the
0	knees
0	with
0	strings
0	.

0	They
0	are
0	filthy
0	beyond
0	imagination
0	.

0	They
0	never
0	wash
0	their
0	hands
0	or
0	faces
0	,
0	nor
0	pare
0	their
0	nails
0	.

0	They
0	eat
0	out
0	of
0	the
0	same
0	dish
0	with
0	the
0	dogs
0	,
0	which
0	they
0	never
0	wash
0	.

0	Both
0	men
0	and
0	women
0	plait
0	their
0	hair
0	in
0	two
0	locks
0	,
0	which
0	they
0	never
0	comb
0	;

0	and
0	those
0	who
0	have
0	short
0	hair
0	,
0	supply
0	the
0	locks
0	with
0	false
0	.

0	This
0	is
0	said
0	of
0	the
0	Kamshatskadales
0	,
0	who
0	live
0	more
0	to
0	the
0	North
0	;

0	those
0	in
0	the
0	towns
0	which
0	we
0	saw
0	,
0	had
0	learnt
0	of
0	the
0	Russians
0	to
0	be
0	more
0	cleanly
0	.

0	They
0	are
0	very
0	superstitious
0	:
0	and
0	the
0	women
0	in
0	particular
0	pretend
0	to
0	avert
0	misfortunes
0	,
0	cure
0	diseases
0	,
0	and
0	foretel
0	future
0	events
0	,
0	by
0	muttering
0	incantations
0	over
0	the
0	fins
0	of
0	fishes
0	,
0	mingled
0	with
0	a
0	certain
0	herb
0	,
0	which
0	they
0	gather
0	from
0	the
0	woods
0	with
0	much
0	labour
0	.

0	They
0	pretend
0	also
0	to
0	judge
0	of
0	good
0	and
0	bad
0	fortune
0	,
0	by
0	the
0	lines
0	of
0	the
0	hands
0	,
0	and
0	by
0	their
0	dreams
0	,
0	which
0	they
0	relate
0	to
0	each
0	other
0	as
0	soon
0	as
0	they
0	awake
0	.

0	They
0	dread
0	going
0	near
0	the
0	burning
0	mountains
0	,
0	lest
0	the
0	invisible
0	beings
0	that
0	inhabit
0	them
0	should
0	hurt
0	them
0	;

0	and
0	think
0	it
0	a
0	sin
0	to
0	drink
0	or
0	to
0	bathe
0	in
0	the
0	hot
0	springs
0	,
0	with
0	which
0	their
0	country
0	abounds
0	,
0	because
0	they
0	suppose
0	those
0	springs
0	to
0	be
0	heated
0	by
0	the
0	evil
0	spirits
0	that
0	produce
0	them
0	.

0	They
0	are
0	said
0	never
0	to
0	bury
0	their
0	dead
0	;

0	but
0	,
0	binding
0	a
0	strap
0	round
0	the
0	neck
0	of
0	the
0	corpse
0	,
0	drag
0	it
0	to
0	the
0	next
0	forest
0	,
0	where
0	they
0	leave
0	it
0	to
0	be
0	eaten
0	by
0	the
0	bears
0	,
0	wolves
0	,
0	or
0	other
0	wild
0	inhabitants
0	.

0	They
0	have
0	a
0	notion
0	that
0	they
0	who
0	are
0	eaten
0	with
0	dogs
0	will
0	drive
0	with
0	fine
0	dogs
0	in
0	another
0	world
0	.

0	They
0	throw
0	away
0	all
0	the
0	clothes
0	of
0	the
0	deceased
0	,
0	because
0	they
0	believe
0	that
0	they
0	who
0	wear
0	them
0	will
0	die
0	before
0	their
0	time
0	.

0	The
0	country
0	is
0	said
0	to
0	abound
0	with
0	wild
0	beasts
0	,
0	which
0	constitute
0	the
0	principal
0	riches
0	of
0	the

0	;

0	particularly
0	foxes

0	but
0	our
0	gentlemen
0	were
0	much
0	disappointed
0	,
0	who
0	went
0	in
0	pursuit
0	of
0	them
0	.

0	The
0	only
0	game
0	they
0	killed
0	was
0	a

0	,
0	though
0	they
0	diverted
0	themselves
0	in
0	hunting
0	with
0	the
0	natives
0	for
0	several
0	days
0	:
0	nor
0	were
0	they
0	much
0	more
0	successful
0	in
0	shooting
0	;

0	even
0	the
0	sea-fowl
0	were
0	hardly
0	to
0	be
0	come
0	at
0	,
0	they
0	were
0	so
0	watchful
0	.

0	They
0	have
0	a
0	species
0	of
0	weasle
0	,
0	called
0	the
0	glutton
0	,
0	whose
0	fur
0	is
0	so
0	much
0	more
0	esteemed
0	than
0	all
0	others
0	,
0	that
0	they
0	say
0	the
0	good
0	spirits
0	are
0	clothed
0	with
0	it
0	.

0	The
0	paws
0	of
0	this
0	animal
0	are
0	white
0	as
0	snow
0	,
0	but
0	the
0	hair
0	of
0	the
0	body
0	is
0	yellow
0	.

0	Sixty
0	rubles
0	(
0	about
0	12
0	guineas
0	nearly
0	)
0	have
0	been
0	given
0	for
0	a
0	skin
0	,
0	and
0	a
0	sea-beaver
0	for
0	a
0	single
0	paw
0	.

0	Of
0	the
0	bears
0	,
0	the
0	inhabitants
0	make
0	good
0	use
0	;

0	of
0	their
0	skins
0	they
0	make
0	their
0	beds
0	,
0	coverings
0	,
0	caps
0	,
0	collars
0	,
0	and
0	gloves
0	;

0	and
0	of
0	their
0	flesh
0	and
0	fat
0	,
0	their
0	most
0	delicious
0	food
0	;

0	but
0	their
0	manner
0	of
0	hunting
0	them
0	,
0	is
0	attended
0	with
0	much
0	danger
0	and
0	little
0	profit
0	.

0	They
0	watch
0	their
0	haunts
0	,
0	and
0	follow
0	their
0	tracks
0	to
0	the
0	lakes
0	where
0	they
0	resort
0	.

0	They
0	then
0	choose
0	some
0	convenient
0	place
0	to
0	conceal
0	themselves
0	,
0	to
0	be
0	in
0	readiness
0	to
0	watch
0	their
0	prey
0	.

0	They
0	then
0	plant
0	their
0	rests
0	(
0	for
0	no
0	Kamtshatskadale
0	ever
0	shoots
0	without
0	a
0	rest
0	)
0	and
0	when
0	the
0	bear
0	comes
0	within
0	distance
0	,
0	they
0	point
0	their
0	guns
0	,
0	and
0	let
0	fly
0	.

0	If
0	they
0	kill
0	or
0	maim
0	,
0	so
0	that
0	the
0	bear
0	cannot
0	pursue
0	,
0	'
0	tis
0	well
0	;

0	but
0	if
0	they
0	miss
0	,
0	as
0	they
0	frequently
0	do
0	,
0	'tis
0	happy
0	for
0	the
0	hunter
0	if
0	he
0	escapes
0	.

0	The
0	enraged
0	beast
0	makes
0	at
0	the
0	place
0	whence
0	the
0	report
0	is
0	heard
0	,
0	and
0	,
0	if
0	not
0	received
0	on
0	the
0	hunter
0	's
0	spear
0	,
0	which
0	he
0	always
0	has
0	in
0	reserve
0	,
0	the
0	combat
0	becomes
0	so
0	unequal
0	,
0	that
0	the
0	bear
0	is
0	generally
0	the
0	conqueror
0	.

0	The
0	Kamshatskadales
0	,
0	all
0	along
0	the
0	Northern
0	coasts
0	,
0	have
0	a
0	particular
0	manner
0	of
0	dressing
0	their
0	food
0	,
0	which
0	is
0	the
0	very
0	reverse
0	of
0	that
0	of
0	the
0	Indians
0	in
0	the
0	South
0	.

0	There
0	they
0	roast
0	or
0	stew
0	with
0	stones
0	made
0	hot
0	and
0	buried
0	,
0	as
0	it
0	were
0	,
0	in
0	the
0	earth
0	with
0	their
0	meat
0	,
0	by
0	which
0	its
0	relish
0	is
0	said
0	to
0	be
0	much
0	improved
0	.

0	But
0	here
0	they
0	boil
0	it
0	with
0	hot
0	stones
0	immersed
0	in
0	water
0	,
0	by
0	which
0	its
0	flavour
0	is
0	rendered
0	more
0	insipid
0	.

0	The
0	same
0	necessity
0	,
0	however
0	,
0	seems
0	to
0	have
0	pointed
0	out
0	the
0	same
0	means
0	to
0	the
0	people
0	of
0	the
0	torrid
0	and
0	the
0	frigid
0	zones
0	;

0	for
0	both
0	being
0	equally
0	unacquainted
0	with
0	iron
0	,
0	and
0	wood
0	being
0	incapable
0	of
0	resisting
0	fire
0	,
0	when
0	brought
0	in
0	contact
0	with
0	it
0	,
0	though
0	the
0	principle
0	was
0	obvious
0	,
0	the
0	application
0	was
0	difficult
0	;

0	those
0	,
0	therefore
0	,
0	of
0	the
0	torrid
0	zone
0	,
0	would
0	naturally
0	be
0	led
0	to
0	call
0	the
0	warmth
0	of
0	the
0	earth
0	to
0	their
0	aid
0	;

0	whilst
0	those
0	in
0	the
0	frozen
0	climates
0	,
0	would
0	think
0	water
0	a
0	more
0	ready
0	assistant
0	:
0	add
0	to
0	this
0	,
0	that
0	the
0	colder
0	regions
0	abound
0	with
0	hot
0	springs
0	;

0	some
0	in
0	Kamshatska
0	,
0	in
0	particular
0	,
0	are
0	so
0	hot
0	,
0	as
0	to
0	approach
0	nearly
0	to
0	the
0	degree
0	of
0	boiling
0	water
0	;

0	but
0	these
0	they
0	think
0	it
0	sinful
0	to
0	use
0	,
0	as
0	we
0	have
0	already
0	observed
0	.

0	The
0	dogs
0	of
0	this
0	country
0	are
0	like
0	our
0	village
0	curs
0	,
0	and
0	are
0	of
0	different
0	colours
0	.

0	They
0	feed
0	chiefly
0	on
0	fish
0	;

0	and
0	their
0	masters
0	use
0	them
0	,
0	instead
0	of
0	horses
0	or
0	rein-deer
0	,
0	to
0	draw
0	sledges
0	.

0	The
0	seas
0	and
0	lakes
0	abound
0	with
0	a
0	variety
0	of
0	amphibious
0	animals
0	,
0	of
0	which
0	seals
0	and
0	sea-horses
0	and
0	sea-cows
0	,
0	are
0	the
0	most
0	numerous
0	and
0	the
0	most
0	profitable
0	.

0	Of
0	the
0	skins
0	of
0	the
0	seal
0	they
0	make
0	their
0	canoes
0	,
0	and
0	on
0	their
0	flesh
0	and
0	fat
0	they
0	feed
0	deliciously
0	.

0	Whales
0	are
0	sometimes
0	cast
0	upon
0	the
0	shores
0	,
0	but
0	very
0	seldom
0	,
0	unless
0	wounded
0	.

0	With
0	the
0	teeth
0	and
0	bones
0	of
0	the
0	sea-horse
0	and
0	sea-cow
0	,
0	they
0	point
0	their
0	arrows
0	and
0	weapons
0	of
0	war
0	;

0	and
0	of
0	their
0	fat
0	and
0	blubber
0	they
0	make
0	their
0	oil
0	.

0	They
0	have
0	otters
0	in
0	their
0	lakes
0	,
0	but
0	their
0	skins
0	bear
0	a
0	great
0	price
0	.

0	They
0	have
0	birds
0	of
0	various
0	kinds
0	in
0	great
0	abundance
0	.

0	Among
0	the
0	sea-fowl
0	,
0	they
0	have
0	the
0	puffin
0	,
0	the
0	sea-crow
0	,
0	the
0	Greenland
0	pigeon
0	,
0	and
0	the
0	cormorant
0	.

0	They
0	have
0	swans
0	,
0	geese
0	,
0	and
0	eleven
0	species
0	of
0	ducks
0	;

0	and
0	they
0	have
0	plovers
0	,
0	snipes
0	,
0	and
0	small
0	birds
0	without
0	number
0	.

0	They
0	have
0	likewise
0	four
0	kinds
0	of
0	eagles
0	;

0	the
0	black
0	eagle
0	,
0	with
0	a
0	white
0	head
0	;

0	the
0	white
0	eagle
0	;

0	the
0	spotted
0	eagle
0	,
0	and
0	the
0	brown
0	eagle
0	.

0	They
0	have
0	vultures
0	also
0	,
0	and
0	hawks
0	innumerable
0	.

0	This
0	country
0	swarms
0	with
0	insects
0	in
0	the
0	summer
0	,
0	which
0	are
0	very
0	troublesome
0	;

0	but
0	they
0	have
0	neither
0	frog
0	,
0	toad
0	,
0	nor
0	serpent
0	.

0	Lizards
0	are
0	not
0	rare
0	;

0	but
0	they
0	believe
0	these
0	creatures
0	to
0	be
0	spies
0	,
0	sent
0	from
0	the
0	infernal
0	powers
0	to
0	inspect
0	their
0	lives
0	and
0	foretel
0	their
0	deaths
0	;

0	and
0	therefore
0	whenever
0	they
0	see
0	one
0	,
0	they
0	kill
0	it
0	,
0	and
0	cut
0	it
0	into
0	small
0	pieces
0	,
0	that
0	it
0	may
0	not
0	carry
0	back
0	any
0	intelligence
0	to
0	their
0	hurt
0	.

0	But
0	what
0	is
0	most
0	remarkable
0	,
0	and
0	deserves
0	the
0	attention
0	of
0	the
0	curious
0	,
0	is
0	the
0	general
0	conformity
0	between
0	the
0	Kamshatskadales
0	towards
0	the
0	East
0	,
0	and
0	of
0	the
0	Americans
0	,
0	that
0	live
0	on
0	the
0	opposite
0	coast
0	,
0	just
0	over
0	against
0	them
0	,
0	in
0	their
0	persons
0	,
0	habits
0	,
0	customs
0	,
0	and
0	food
0	;

0	both
0	dress
0	exactly
0	in
0	the
0	same
0	manner
0	;

0	both
0	cut
0	holes
0	in
0	their
0	faces
0	in
0	the
0	manner
0	already
0	described
0	,
0	in
0	which
0	they
0	put
0	bones
0	like
0	false
0	teeth
0	,
0	by
0	way
0	of
0	ornament
0	;

0	and
0	both
0	make
0	their
0	canoes
0	exactly
0	on
0	the
0	same
0	construction
0	.

0	These
0	are
0	about
0	twelve
0	feet
0	long
0	and
0	two
0	/
0	&gt;
0	broad
0	,
0	sharp
0	at
0	the
0	head
0	and
0	stern
0	,
0	and
0	flat
0	at
0	the
0	bottom
0	;

0	they
0	consist
0	of
0	flat
0	pieces
0	of
0	wood
0	,
0	joined
0	at
0	both
0	ends
0	,
0	and
0	kept
0	apart
0	in
0	the
0	middle
0	by
0	a
0	transverse
0	piece
0	,
0	through
0	which
0	there
0	is
0	a
0	round
0	hole
0	,
0	just
0	large
0	enough
0	for
0	the
0	man
0	to
0	insert
0	his
0	legs
0	,
0	and
0	to
0	seat
0	himself
0	on
0	a
0	bench
0	made
0	on
0	purpose
0	;

0	this
0	skeleton
0	is
0	covered
0	with
0	seal-skin
0	,
0	dyed
0	of
0	a
0	kind
0	of
0	purple
0	colour
0	,
0	and
0	the
0	whole
0	is
0	skirted
0	with
0	loose
0	skin
0	,
0	which
0	,
0	when
0	the
0	man
0	is
0	seated
0	,
0	he
0	draws
0	close
0	round
0	him
0	,
0	like
0	the
0	mouth
0	of
0	a
0	purse
0	;

0	and
0	,
0	with
0	a
0	coat
0	and
0	a
0	cap
0	of
0	the
0	same
0	skin
0	,
0	which
0	covers
0	his
0	whole
0	body
0	,
0	makes
0	the
0	man
0	and
0	his
0	boat
0	appear
0	like
0	one
0	piece
0	;

0	and
0	thus
0	clad
0	,
0	and
0	thus
0	seated
0	and
0	surrounded
0	,
0	he
0	fears
0	neither
0	the
0	roughest
0	sea
0	,
0	nor
0	the
0	severest
0	weather
0	.

0	But
0	here
0	it
0	is
0	necessary
0	to
0	distinguish
0	between
0	the
0	native
0	Kamshatskadales
0	and
0	the
0	Russians
0	who
0	live
0	at
0	Kamtshatska
0	,
0	who
0	preserve
0	the
0	Russian
0	language
0	and
0	the
0	Russian
0	manners
0	.

0	And
0	now
0	we
0	have
0	had
0	occasion
0	to
0	mention
0	this
0	similiarity
0	between
0	the
0	inhabitants
0	on
0	the
0	opposite
0	shores
0	of
PLACE-B	Asia
0	and
PLACE-B	America
0	,
0	we
0	shall
0	embrace
0	this
0	opportunity
0	to
0	correct
0	a
0	very
0	material
0	error
0	in
0	our
0	account
0	of
0	our
0	last
0	year
0	's
0	voyage
0	,
0	where
0	,
0	speaking
0	of
0	the
0	Russian
0	Discoveries
0	,
0	we
0	took
0	notice
0	,
0	after
0	examining
0	Beering
0	's
0	Straits
0	,
0	though
0	the
0	Russians
0	supposed
0	that
0	the
0	lands
0	were
0	parted
0	,
0	here
0	we
0	found
0	the
0	continent
0	to
0	join
0	,
0	by
0	which
0	the
0	Reader
0	will
0	,
0	no
0	doubt
0	,
0	imagine
0	,
0	that
0	we
0	have
0	asserted
0	,
0	that
0	the
0	two
0	continents
0	of
PLACE-B	Asia
0	and
PLACE-B	America
0	join
0	,
0	which
0	they
0	do
0	not
0	;

0	but
0	are
0	separated
0	by
0	a
0	strait
0	between
0	two
0	promontories
0	,
0	which
0	in
0	clear
0	weather
0	are
0	so
0	near
0	as
0	to
0	be
0	seen
0	in
0	sailing
0	through
0	with
0	the
0	naked
0	eye
0	.

0	But
0	what
0	is
0	meant
0	is
0	this
0	.

0	When
0	Beering
0	made
0	his
0	discovery

0	or

0	which
0	having

0	he

0	bay
0	,
0	which
0	he
0	imagined
0	was
0	another

0	and
0	that
0	the

0	which
0	he
0	had
0	passed
0	was
0	not
0	the

0	by

0	This

0	About

0	in

0	our

0	,
0	and
0	of
0	the

0	;

0	and
0	that
0	five

0	now
0	at
0	Vampo
0	,

0	On
0	the
0	2d
0	,
0	early
0	in
0	the

0	,
0	we
0	made

0	,
0	and
0	anchored
0	a-breast
0	of
0	the
0	island
0	,
0	and
0	saluted
0	the

0	with

0	We

0	,
0	when

0	by
0	two
0	English

0	,
0	who
0	,
0	after

0	who
0	we
0	were
0	,
0	and
0	what
0	we
0	had
0	been
0	upon
0	,
0	persuaded
0	the
0	Commodore
0	to
0	leave
0	our
0	then
0	situation
0	,
0	and
0	to

0	where

0	It
0	was
0	now
0	three
0	years
0	since

0	,
0	the

0	all
0	which
0	was
0	complied
0	with

0	and
0	the

0	were
0	made
0	up
0	and

0	by

0	.

0	The
0	boats
0	were
0	then
0	ordered
0	out
0	,
0	and
0	sent
0	to
PLACE-B	Macao
0	for
0	fresh
0	provisions
0	,
0	which
0	next

0	dealt
0	out
0	to

0	at

0	But
0	before
0	these
0	could
0	return
0	,
0	there
0	came
0	from
0	the

0	boats
0	with

0	;

0	some

0	to

0	;

0	but
0	by
0	far
0	the
0	greatest
0	part
0	to
0	make
0	their
0	market
0	.

0	Being
0	now
0	safely
0	moored
0	,
0	the
0	first
0	thing
0	that
0	claimed
0	the
0	attention
0	of
0	the
0	Commodore
0	,
0	was
0	to
0	provide
0	as
0	well
0	as
0	he
0	could
0	for
0	the
0	safety
0	of
0	the
0	crews
0	in
0	their
0	return
0	home
0	.

0	The
0	news
0	of
0	a
0	French
0	war
0	,
0	without
0	letting
0	us
0	know
0	at
0	the
0	same
0	time
0	the
0	order
0	issued
0	by
0	the
0	French
0	king
0	in
0	our
0	favour
0	,
0	gave
0	us
0	much
0	concern
0	.

0	Our
0	ships
0	were
0	ill
0	fitted
0	for
0	war
0	;

0	the
0	decks
0	fore
0	and
0	aft
0	being
0	finished
0	flush
0	,
0	had
0	no
0	covering
0	for
0	men
0	or
0	officers
0	;

0	it
0	was
0	therefore
0	thought
0	necessary
0	to
0	strengthen
0	the
0	stanchions
0	and
0	rails
0	,
0	and
0	to
0	raise
0	a
0	kind
0	of
0	parapet
0	,
0	musket-proof
0	on
0	both
0	decks
0	;

0	and
0	likewise
0	to
0	strengthen
0	the
0	cabins
0	as
0	much
0	as
0	possible
0	,
0	in
0	case
0	of
0	action
0	.

0	And
0	as
0	it
0	was
0	agreed
0	that
0	both
0	ships
0	could
0	carry
0	more
0	guns
0	,
0	if
0	any
0	were
0	to
0	be
0	purchased
0	,
0	the
0	Commodore
0	was
0	for
0	taking
0	the
0	ships
0	to
0	Canton
0	,
0	till
0	persuaded
0	from
0	it
0	by
0	some
0	gentlemen
0	belonging
0	to
0	the
0	English
0	factory
0	,
0	who
0	undertook
0	to
0	negociate
0	the
0	business
0	without
0	giving
0	umbrage
0	to
0	the
0	Chinese
0	,
0	who
0	certainly
0	would
0	,
0	they
0	said
0	,
0	be
0	offended
0	at
0	the
0	appearance
0	of
0	ships
0	of
0	war
0	in
0	their
0	river
0	,
0	and
0	would
0	oppose
0	their
0	progress
0	;

0	reminding
0	him
0	at
0	the
0	same
0	time
0	,
0	of
0	the
0	disagreeable
0	dispute
0	in
0	which
0	Commodore
PERSON-B	Anson
0	was
0	formerly
0	involved
0	on
0	a
0	similar
0	occasion
0	;

0	and
0	how
0	hurtful
0	it
0	was
0	to
0	the
0	Company
0	's
0	commerce
0	for
0	several
0	years
0	after
0	.

0	Upon
0	these
0	representations
0	the
0	Commodore
0	relinquished
0	his
0	design
0	,
0	and
0	Capt.
0	King
0	,
0	with
0	other
0	officers
0	,
0	were
0	sent
0	in
0	a
0	Company
0	's
0	ship
0	,
0	assisted
0	by
0	one
0	or
0	two
0	gentlemen
0	belonging
0	to
0	the
0	factory
0	,
0	to
0	Canton
0	,
0	to
0	purchase
0	cannon
0	and
0	such
0	other
0	stores
0	as
0	were
0	not
0	to
0	be
0	had
0	at
PLACE-B	Macao
0	.

0	On
0	the
0	18th
0	they
0	set
0	sail
0	,
0	and
0	at
0	the
0	same
0	time
0	two
0	Portuguese
0	vessels
0	from
0	the
0	harbour
0	of
PLACE-B	Macao
0	,
0	came
0	and
0	anchored
0	close
0	by
0	us
0	.

0	They
0	were
0	bound
0	to
PLACE-B	Bengal
0	and
PLACE-B	Madras
0	,
0	and
0	very
0	readily
0	assisted
0	us
0	with
0	ropes
0	for
0	running
0	rigging
0	,
0	some
0	canvas
0	,
0	and
0	with
0	60
0	fathom
0	of
0	cable
0	.

0	They
0	likewise
0	exchanged
0	four
0	small
0	cannon
0	and
0	some
0	shot
0	with
0	the
0	Discovery
0	for
0	a
0	spare
0	anchor
0	.

0	The
0	25th
0	,
0	being
0	Christmas-day
0	,
0	was
0	kept
0	,
0	as
0	is
0	usual
0	with
0	English
0	sailors
0	,
0	in
0	jollity
0	and
0	mirth
0	;

0	and
0	what
0	added
0	to
0	the
0	pleasure
0	of
0	the
0	day
0	,
0	there
0	was
0	not
0	a
0	man
0	ill
0	in
0	either
0	ship
0	.

0	On
0	the
0	28th
0	the
0	Commodore
0	received
0	a
0	letter
0	from
PERSON-B	Capt.
PERSON-I	King
0	,
0	with
0	an
0	account
0	of
0	the
0	disasters
0	that
0	had
0	happened
0	in
0	the
0	passage
0	,
0	having
0	lost
0	two
0	anchors
0	and
0	their
0	boat
0	,
0	and
0	were
0	several
0	times
0	in
0	danger
0	of
0	running
0	ashore
0	;

0	that
0	they
0	did
0	not
0	arrive
0	at
0	Canton
0	till
0	the
0	24th
0	;

0	but
0	that
0	he
0	hoped
0	soon
0	to
0	return
0	with
0	the
0	cannon
0	and
0	stores
0	,
0	for
0	which
0	he
0	had
0	bargained
0	,
0	though
0	at
0	a
0	great
0	price
0	.

0	Here
0	they
0	learnt
0	that
0	the
0	skins
0	we
0	had
0	brought
0	with
0	us
0	from
0	the
0	N.
0	W.
0	Continent
0	of
PLACE-B	America
0	,
0	were
0	of
0	nearly
0	double
0	the
0	value
0	at
0	Canton
0	,
0	as
0	at
0	Kamshatska
0	.

0	Early
0	on
0	the
0	29th
0	there
0	came
0	into
0	the
0	harbour
0	of
PLACE-B	Macao
0	a
0	Spanish
0	galleon
0	from
PLACE-B	Manilla
0	,
0	said
0	to
0	have
0	more
0	than
0	two
0	millions
0	of
0	treasure
0	on
0	board
0	;

0	and
0	before
0	we
0	left
0	our
0	station
0	,
0	there
0	came
0	in
0	another
0	worth
0	double
0	that
0	sum
0	.

0	We
0	were
0	unacquainted
0	with
0	the
0	Spanish
0	war
0	,
0	or
0	these
0	ships
0	,
0	had
0	we
0	been
0	properly
0	commissioned
0	,
0	might
0	easily
0	have
0	been
0	captured
0	.

0	It
0	is
0	astonishing
0	,
0	that
0	none
0	of
0	our
0	cruisers
0	have
0	ever
0	lain
0	in
0	wait
0	for
0	these
0	ships
0	,
0	as
0	their
0	voyage
0	is
0	annual
0	,
0	and
0	their
0	course
0	known
0	.

0	The
0	same
0	evening
0	a
0	quarrel
0	happened
0	between
0	a
0	party
0	of
0	our
0	sailors
0	,
0	on
0	shore
0	with
0	leave
0	,
0	and
0	some
0	of
0	the
0	town
0	's
0	people
0	,
0	in
0	which
0	several
0	were
0	dangerously
0	wounded
0	on
0	both
0	sides
0	;

0	and
PERSON-B	Mr.
PERSON-I	Burney
0	,
0	first
0	Lieutenant
0	of
0	the
0	Resolution
0	,
0	had
0	a
0	dagger
0	run
0	through
0	his
0	left
0	arm
0	in
0	endeavouring
0	to
0	put
0	an
0	end
0	to
0	the
0	fray
0	.

0	For
0	this
0	insult
0	the
0	Governor
0	sent
0	to
0	demand
0	satisfaction
0	;

0	but
0	upon
0	examination
0	,
0	the
0	town
0	's
0	people
0	were
0	found
0	to
0	be
0	the
0	aggressors
0	.

0	The
0	Governor
0	made
0	a
0	very
0	handsome
0	apology
0	for
0	his
0	mistake
0	,
0	and
0	the
0	affair
0	ended
0	without
0	any
0	serious
0	consequences
0	.

0	We
0	were
0	now
0	visited
0	daily
0	by
0	strangers
0	,
0	who
0	came
0	out
0	of
0	curiosity
0	to
0	see
0	ships
0	that
0	had
0	been
0	so
0	many
0	years
0	upon
0	discovery
0	;

0	and
0	every
0	one
0	was
0	anxious
0	to
0	learn
0	what
0	he
0	could
0	concerning
0	our
0	course
0	,
0	but
0	that
0	we
0	were
0	not
0	at
0	liberty
0	to
0	tell
0	them
0	.

0	Among
0	the
0	rest
0	came
0	two
0	French
0	spies
0	,
0	as
0	we
0	imagined
0	;

0	but
0	not
0	being
0	able
0	to
0	make
0	out
0	any
0	thing
0	criminal
0	against
0	them
0	,
0	they
0	were
0	suffered
0	to
0	depart
0	.

0	The
0	suspicion
0	arose
0	from
0	some
0	of
0	our
0	men
0	,
0	who
0	having
0	particularly
0	marked
0	them
0	,
0	insisted
0	that
0	they
0	had
0	formerly
0	sailed
0	with
0	them
0	in
0	the
0	French
0	service
0	.

0	Nothing
0	remarkable
0	till
0	Jan.
0	the
0	8th
0	,
0	1780
0	,
0	when
PERSON-B	Capt.
PERSON-I	King
0	,
0	with
0	the
0	officers
0	that
0	accompanied
0	him
0	,
0	arrived
0	in
0	the
0	Company
0	's
0	vessel
0	,
0	with
0	the
0	cannon
0	,
0	ammunition
0	,
0	and
0	stores
0	from
0	Canton
0	.

0	These
0	being
0	shipped
0	,
0	nothing
0	remained
0	to
0	be
0	done
0	,
0	but
0	to
0	take
0	on
0	board
0	the
0	live
0	stock
0	which
0	the
0	Commodore
0	and
0	officers
0	had
0	purchased
0	for
0	their
0	own
0	use
0	,
0	and
0	nine
0	head
0	of
0	cattle
0	to
0	be
0	killed
0	at
0	sea
0	for
0	the
0	use
0	of
0	the
0	ship
0	's
0	company
0	;

0	the
0	beef
0	and
0	pork
0	which
0	we
0	brought
0	from
PLACE-B	England
0	,
0	being
0	now
0	scarce
0	eatable
0	.

0	Provisions
0	of
0	all
0	kinds
0	were
0	here
0	very
0	dear
0	,
0	and
0	very
0	indifferent
0	;

0	but
0	what
0	made
0	us
0	amends
0	,
0	was
0	the
0	price
0	they
0	gave
0	for
0	our
0	furs
0	,
0	on
0	which
0	they
0	set
0	a
0	great
0	value
0	.

0	On
0	the
0	11th
0	of
0	January
0	we
0	unmoored
0	,
0	and
0	the
0	wind
0	being
0	fair
0	,
0	came
0	to
0	sail
0	with
0	a
0	pleasant
0	breeze
0	;

0	but
0	the
0	wind
0	dying
0	away
0	in
0	the
0	evening
0	,
0	we
0	cast
0	anchor
0	;

0	and
0	in
0	the
0	night
0	,
0	John
0	Cave
0	,
0	Quarter-master
0	,
0	and
0	Robert
0	Spencer
0	,
0	ran
0	away
0	with
0	the
0	great
0	cutter
0	.

0	And
0	On
0	the
0	12th
0	,
0	we
0	were
0	the
0	whole
0	day
0	detained
0	in
0	endeavouring
0	to
0	recover
0	them
0	,
0	but
0	to
0	no
0	purpose
0	.

0	On
0	the
0	13th
0	,
0	we
0	passed
0	the
0	fort
0	,
0	and
0	saluted
0	the
0	garrison
0	with
0	13
0	four
0	pounders
0	,
0	which
0	they
0	answered
0	with
0	an
0	equal
0	number
0	.

0	We
0	had
0	now
0	nothing
0	but
0	a
0	beaten
0	track
0	to
0	pass
0	,
0	in
0	our
0	way
0	to
0	our
0	long
0	wished-for
0	native
0	country
0	.

0	On
0	the
0	20th
0	,
0	we
0	made
0	the
0	little
0	group
0	of
0	islands
0	,
0	known
0	by
0	the
0	name
0	of
0	Pulo
0	Condore
0	,
0	in
0	lat
0	.

0	8.40
0	.

0	N.
0	at
0	one
0	of
0	which
0	we
0	anchored
0	,
0	and
0	found
0	it
0	inhabited
0	.

0	Here
0	we
0	both
0	wooded
0	and
0	watered
0	,
0	and
0	the
0	carpenters
0	felled
0	some
0	large
0	trees
0	,
0	which
0	were
0	afterwards
0	sawed
0	on
0	board
0	.

0	The
0	trees
0	on
0	these
0	islands
0	are
0	chiefly
0	cedar
0	,
0	iron-wood
0	,
0	mangrove
0	,
0	manchinael
0	,
0	and
0	box
0	.

0	Some
0	nutmeg-trees
0	there
0	were
0	,
0	but
0	of
0	a
0	wild
0	kind
0	,
0	that
0	bear
0	a
0	fruit
0	without
0	taste
0	or
0	smell
0	.

0	In
0	pursuit
0	of
0	game
0	,
0	of
0	which
0	there
0	was
0	plenty
0	,
0	our
0	gentlemen
0	fell
0	in
0	with
0	a
0	party
0	of
0	natives
0	,
0	one
0	of
0	whom
0	accompanied
0	them
0	to
0	the
0	ships
0	.

0	We
0	made
0	him
0	understand
0	that
0	we
0	wanted
0	provisions
0	;

0	and
0	he
0	had
0	not
0	left
0	us
0	long
0	,
0	before
0	a
0	number
0	of
0	boats
0	came
0	round
0	the
0	island
0	,
0	laden
0	with
0	fruits
0	,
0	fowls
0	,
0	ducks
0	,
0	and
0	other
0	provisions
0	,
0	which
0	they
0	readily
0	exchanged
0	for
0	any
0	thing
0	we
0	offered
0	them
0	,
0	though
0	they
0	were
0	not
0	wholly
0	unacquainted
0	with
0	the
0	use
0	of
0	money
0	;

0	for
0	being
0	informed
0	that
0	herds
0	of
0	buffaloes
0	were
0	on
0	the
0	island
0	,
0	we
0	purchased
0	seven
0	;

0	three
0	of
0	them
0	,
0	of
0	a
0	large
0	size
0	,
0	n
0	=
0	"
0	370
0	"
0	/
0	&gt;
0	from
0	four
0	to
0	seven
0	dollars
0	each
0	.

0	These
0	were
0	fierce
0	animals
0	,
0	and
0	were
0	not
0	easily
0	brought
0	on
0	board
0	;

0	but
0	after
0	being
0	subdued
0	,
0	were
0	as
0	gentle
0	and
0	tractable
0	as
0	the
0	gentlest
0	of
0	our
0	other
0	cattle
0	.

0	What
0	seems
0	surprising
0	is
0	,
0	that
0	the
0	men
0	on
0	the
0	island
0	dare
0	hardly
0	go
0	near
0	them
0	when
0	loose
0	in
0	the
0	woods
0	;

0	but
0	they
0	will
0	suffer
0	little
0	boys
0	to
0	handle
0	and
0	halter
0	them
0	,
0	which
0	is
0	done
0	by
0	passing
0	a
0	rope
0	through
0	a
0	hole
0	made
0	in
0	their
0	nostrils
0	,
0	and
0	round
0	their
0	horns
0	;

0	notwithstanding
0	which
0	,
0	some
0	of
0	them
0	broke
0	the
0	trees
0	down
0	to
0	which
0	they
0	were
0	fastened
0	.

0	Here
0	we
0	found
0	the
0	cabbage-tree
0	,
0	and
0	other
0	succulent
0	greens
0	,
0	with
0	which
0	our
0	people
0	made
0	very
0	free
0	,
0	without
0	asking
0	questions
0	.

0	On
0	the
0	28th
0	we
0	unmoored
0	;

0	and
0	on
0	The
0	31st
0	,
0	made
0	the
0	island
0	of
0	Banka
0	;

0	and
0	having
0	passed
0	the
0	Straits
0	,
0	On
0	the
0	5th
0	of
0	February
0	,
0	we
0	made
0	the
0	island
0	of
PLACE-B	Sumatra
0	,
0	where
0	we
0	saw
0	a
0	large
0	ship
0	lying
0	at
0	anchor
0	;

0	and
0	On
0	the
0	7th
0	,
0	passed
0	the
0	island
0	of
PLACE-B	Java
0	,
0	where
0	we
0	saw
0	two
0	more
0	.

0	We
0	made
0	the
0	signal
0	to
0	the
0	Discovery
0	to
0	prepare
0	for
0	action
0	,
0	and
0	we
0	did
0	the
0	same
0	,
0	hoisting
0	English
0	colours
0	.

0	It
0	was
0	some
0	time
0	before
0	they
0	shewed
0	any
0	,
0	but
0	,
0	at
0	length
0	,
0	they
0	hoisted
0	Dutch
0	colours
0	.

0	We
0	sent
0	our
0	boat
0	on
0	board
0	,
0	and
0	received
0	the
0	first
0	news
0	of
0	a
0	Spanish
0	war
0	.

0	We
0	pursued
0	our
0	course
0	;

0	and
0	On
0	the
0	11th
0	,
0	we
0	made
0	the
0	island
0	of
0	Cocoterra
0	.

0	Here
0	,
0	from
0	a
0	healthy
0	ship
0	's
0	company
0	,
0	several
0	of
0	our
0	people
0	fell
0	ill
0	of
0	the
0	flux
0	,
0	and
0	so
0	continued
0	for
0	some
0	time
0	;

0	however
0	,
0	having
0	got
0	plenty
0	of
0	good
0	water
0	on
0	board
0	,
0	we
0	sailed
0	On
0	the
0	13th
0	,
0	directing
0	our
0	course
0	to
0	Prince
0	's
0	island
0	.

0	On
0	the
0	15th
0	,
0	we
0	entered
0	the
0	bay
0	of
0	Prince
0	's
0	island
0	,
0	where
PERSON-B	Capt.
PERSON-I	Cook
0	,
0	when
0	he
0	commanded
0	the
0	Endeavour
0	,
0	anchored
0	in
0	his
0	return
0	to
PLACE-B	Europe
0	.

0	Here
0	we
0	purchased
0	turtles
0	,
0	fowls
0	,
0	and
0	some
0	deer
0	;

0	and
0	here
0	we
0	laid
0	in
0	store
0	of
0	cocoa-nuts
0	,
0	plantains
0	,
0	and
0	other
0	vegetables
0	;

0	and
0	having
0	compleated
0	our
0	stock
0	of
0	water
0	,
0	set
0	sail
0	On
0	the
0	18th
0	,
0	directing
0	our
0	course
0	for
0	the
PLACE-B	Cape
PLACE-I	of
PLACE-I	Good
PLACE-I	Hope
0	.

0	Nothing
0	remarkable
0	till
0	The
0	25th
0	of
0	March
0	,
0	when
0	we
0	were
0	attacked
0	by
0	a
0	severe
0	storm
0	,
0	attended
0	with
0	thunder
0	,
0	lightning
0	and
0	rain
0	,
0	which
0	lasted
0	five
0	days
0	without
0	intermission
0	.

0	On
0	the
0	7th
0	of
0	April
0	,
0	we
0	were
0	alarmed
0	by
0	finding
0	our
0	rudder-head
0	almost
0	twisted
0	off
0	.

0	We
0	got
0	the
0	pendants
0	fixed
0	to
0	steer
0	with
0	tackles
0	,
0	it
0	being
0	the
0	carpenter
0	's
0	opinion
0	it
0	could
0	not
0	last
0	till
0	our
0	arrival
0	at
0	the
0	next
0	port
0	.

0	However
0	,
0	by
0	proper
0	application
0	it
0	lasted
0	till
0	we
0	arrived
0	at
0	the
PLACE-B	Cape
0	.

0	On
0	the
0	9th
0	,
0	we
0	fell
0	in
0	with
PLACE-B	Cape
PLACE-I	Lagullas
0	,
0	where
0	,
0	about
0	nine
0	in
0	the
0	morning
0	,
0	we
0	saw
0	a
0	small
0	vessel
0	cruising
0	,
0	which
0	proved
0	to
0	be
0	the
0	East
PLACE-B	India
PLACE-I	Company
0	's
0	snow
0	,
0	Betsey
0	,
0	looking
0	out
0	for
0	the
0	East
PLACE-B	India
0	fleet
0	.

0	She
0	left
PLACE-B	England
0	the
0	5th
0	of
0	November
0	,
0	and
PLACE-B	False
PLACE-I	Bay
0	on
0	the
0	4th
0	instant
0	.

0	She
0	confirmed
0	the
0	account
0	we
0	had
0	received
0	of
0	the
0	Spanish
0	war
0	.

0	We
0	exchanged
0	some
0	trifles
0	,
0	and
0	soon
0	parted
0	.

0	And
0	On
0	the
0	12th
0	,
0	we
0	entered
PLACE-B	Bay
PLACE-I	False
0	,
0	came
0	to
0	,
0	and
0	moored
0	the
0	same
0	day
0	,
0	after
0	having
0	saluted
0	the
0	fort
0	with
0	13
0	guns
0	,
0	which
0	was
0	answered
0	by
0	the
0	same
0	number
0	.

0	We
0	had
0	scarce
0	dropt
0	anchor
0	,
0	when
0	the
0	Governor
0	came
0	on
0	board
0	,
0	bringing
0	with
0	him
0	a
0	packet
0	of
0	letters
0	for
PERSON-B	Capt.
PERSON-I	Cook
0	,
0	which
0	had
0	lain
0	there
0	ever
0	since
0	the
0	beginning
0	of
0	1779
0	;

0	he
0	had
0	heard
0	of
0	the
0	death
0	of
PERSON-B	Capt.
PERSON-I	Cook
0	by
0	a
0	Dutch
0	vessel
0	,
0	and
0	expressed
0	great
0	concern
0	for
0	that
0	unhappy
0	event
0	,
0	asking
0	a
0	thousand
0	questions
0	concerning
0	the
0	particulars
0	.

0	The
0	first
0	care
0	of
0	our
0	Commodore
0	was
0	to
0	provide
0	for
0	the
0	sick
0	;

0	and
0	by
0	three
0	in
0	the
0	afternoon
0	they
0	were
0	all
0	landed
0	,
0	and
0	sent
0	to
0	the
0	hospital
0	under
0	the
0	care
0	of
PERSON-B	the
PERSON-I	Surgeon
0	's
0	mate
0	.

0	All
0	hands
0	were
0	next
0	set
0	to
0	their
0	different
0	employments
0	,
0	some
0	to
0	wood
0	and
0	water
0	,
0	and
0	some
0	to
0	compleat
0	the
0	repairs
0	.

0	These
0	they
0	forwarded
0	with
0	the
0	utmost
0	expedition
0	,
0	every
0	one
0	being
0	eager
0	to
0	get
0	to
0	his
0	native
0	country
0	.

0	Of
0	the
0	repairs
0	,
0	the
0	Resolution
0	's
0	rudder
0	was
0	the
0	most
0	material
0	.

0	The
0	first
0	thing
0	,
0	therefore
0	,
0	to
0	be
0	done
0	,
0	was
0	to
0	unhinge
0	it
0	and
0	get
0	it
0	on
0	shore
0	;

0	and
0	though
