0	,
0	with
0	a
0	pound
0	and
0	a
0	half
0	of
0	yams
0	,
0	instead
0	of
0	bread
0	;

0	In
0	the
0	Southern
0	parts
0	of
PLACE-B	New
PLACE-I	Zeeland
0	we
0	find
0	the
0	formation
0	of
0	mould
0	and
0	soil
0	much
0	more
0	forward
0	,
0	because
0	its
0	climate
0	is
0	milder
0	,
0	the
0	summer
0	longer
0	,
0	and
0	vegetation
0	more
0	quick
0	and
0	strong
0	:
0	but
0	,
0	upon
0	the
0	whole
0	,
0	we
0	observe
0	the
0	same
0	analogy
0	in
0	its
0	origin
0	.

0	On
0	the
0	26th
0	,
0	at
0	five
0	in
0	the
0	morning
0	,
0	we
0	had
0	a
0	heavy
0	fall
0	of
0	snow
0	,
0	which
0	lasted
0	four
0	hours
0	,
0	with
0	piercing
0	winds
0	the
0	whole
0	day
0	.

0	After
0	the
0	usual
0	salutations
0	,
0	they
0	entered
0	into
0	general
0	conversation
0	,
0	when
0	our
0	gentlemen
0	soon
0	discovered
0	that
0	the
0	Major
0	was
0	not
0	only
0	a
0	man
0	of
0	breeding
0	,
0	but
0	of
0	general
0	knowledge
0	;

0	Through
0	these
0	they
0	made
0	their
0	way
0	with
0	little
0	opposition
0	till
0	the
0	lake
0	appeared
0	to
0	deepen
0	,
0	when
0	a
0	most
0	stubborn
0	woody
0	copse
0	seemed
0	to
0	bid
0	defiance
0	to
0	their
0	further
0	progress
0	.

0	At
0	half
0	past
0	ten
0	,
0	P.
0	M.
0	we
0	were
0	put
0	about
0	,
0	finding
0	by
0	our
0	logbook
0	and
0	watch
0	,
0	that
0	we
0	were
0	fifty
0	miles
0	to
0	leeward
0	of
0	our
0	port
0	.

0	and
0	here
0	we
0	purchased
0	yams
0	and
0	potatoes
0	for
0	our
0	summer
0	's
0	consumption
0	,
0	which
0	the
0	companies
0	of
0	both
0	ships
0	were
0	glad
0	to
0	accept
0	in
0	exchange
0	for
0	their
0	allowance
0	of
0	bread
0	,
0	that
0	part
0	of
0	their
0	food
0	being
0	both
0	scanty
0	and
0	bad
0	.

0	Pounded
0	,
0	we
0	made
0	an
0	excellent
0	liquor
0	from
0	it
0	,
0	very
0	pleasant
0	,
0	and
0	exceedingly
0	wholesome
0	.

0	On
0	these
0	occasions
0	we
0	saw
0	first
0	small
0	pieces
0	of
0	loose
0	,
0	broken
0	ice
0	,
0	full
0	of
0	holes
0	and
0	pores
0	like
0	a
0	spunge
0	,
0	thus
0	wafted
0	by
0	the
0	continual
0	agitation
0	of
0	the
0	waves
0	;

0	In
0	the
0	Northern
0	seas
0	,
0	it
0	is
0	a
0	common
0	and
0	obvious
0	phaenomenon
0	,
0	observed
0	almost
0	every
0	year
0	,
0	that
0	the
0	ice
0	moves
0	towards
0	warmer
0	climates
0	.

0	They
0	had
0	likewise
0	some
0	very
0	pretty
0	baskets
0	of
0	their
0	own
0	making
0	,
0	with
0	other
0	utensils
0	,
0	which
0	plainly
0	indicated
0	a
0	communication
0	with
0	foreign
0	traders
0	.

0	She
0	was
0	a
0	bark
0	of
0	about
0	80
0	tons
0	,
0	and
0	had
0	two
0	guns
0	mounted
0	,
0	which
0	she
0	fired
0	as
0	a
0	salute
0	,
0	when
0	she
0	dropt
0	anchor
0	,
0	and
0	was
0	answered
0	by
0	a
0	volley
0	from
0	the
0	garrison
0	,
0	which
0	consisted
0	of
0	a
0	subaltern
0	and
0	twenty-five
0	soldiers
0	.

0	they
0	were
0	of
0	a
0	dark
0	copper-colour
0	,
0	with
0	lank
0	black
0	hair
0	,
0	which
0	they
0	tied
0	in
0	a
0	knot
0	behind
0	;

0	their
0	breadth
0	from
0	four
0	to
0	five
0	feet
0	over
0	in
0	the
0	middle
0	,
0	and
0	gradually
0	narrowing
0	,
0	like
0	all
0	others
0	,
0	to
0	both
0	ends
0	,
0	but
0	the
0	stem
0	much
0	higher
0	than
0	the
0	stern
0	.

0	These
0	are
0	all
0	monopolized
0	by
0	the
0	Russian
0	Company
0	,
0	already
0	mentioned
0	in
0	our
0	account
0	of
0	the
0	last
0	summer
0	's
0	voyage
0	,
0	and
0	not
0	a
0	skin
0	is
0	to
0	be
0	had
0	from
0	the
0	Kamshatskadales
0	.

0	We
0	were
0	,
0	in
0	less
0	than
0	an
0	hour
0	,
0	surrounded
0	with
0	more
0	than
0	thirty
0	canoes
0	,
0	with
0	rock
0	fish
0	and
0	dried
0	salmon
0	,
0	which
0	they
0	exchanged
0	for
0	beads
0	,
0	small
0	nails
0	,
0	or
0	any
0	thing
0	we
0	offered
0	them
0	.

0	but
0	fortunately
0	laying
0	hold
0	of
0	a
0	rope
0	hanging
0	from
0	the
0	fore-chains
0	into
0	the
0	water
0	,
0	he
0	was
0	got
0	on
0	board
0	,
0	without
0	any
0	other
0	hurt
0	than
0	a
0	slight
0	bruise
0	on
0	one
0	shoulder
0	.

0	Upon
0	these
0	representations
0	the
0	Commodore
0	relinquished
0	his
0	design
0	,
0	and
0	Capt.
PERSON-B	King
0	,
0	with
0	other
0	officers
0	,
0	were
0	sent
0	in
0	a
0	Company
0	's
0	ship
0	,
0	assisted
0	by
0	one
0	or
0	two
0	gentlemen
0	belonging
0	to
0	the
0	factory
0	,
0	to

0	,
0	to
0	purchase
0	cannon
0	and
0	such

0	stores
0	as
0	were
0	not
0	to
0	be
0	had
0	at
PLACE-B	Macao
0	.

0	He
0	lamented
0	his
0	loss
0	with
0	abundance
0	of
0	tears
0	,
0	and
0	earnestly
0	besought
0	us
0	to
0	keep
0	their
0	coming
0	a
0	secret
0	,
0	for
0	if
0	it
0	should
0	be
0	known
0	,
0	it
0	would
0	prove
0	fatal
0	to
0	their
0	whole
0	fraternity
0	.

0	but
PERSON-B	Capt.
PERSON-I	Cook
0	and
0	the
0	other
0	Gentlemen
0	promised
0	to
0	attend
0	.

0	They
0	were
0	strengthened
0	by
0	cross
0	bars
0	,
0	which
0	served
0	both
0	for
0	feats
0	and
0	stretchers
0	,
0	and
0	had
0	small
0	out-riggers
0	,
0	to
0	prevent
0	over-setting
0	.

0	Under
0	this
0	mistake
0	a
0	few
0	guns
0	were
0	fired
0	from
0	the
0	ships
0	to
0	disperse
0	them
0	,
0	by
0	which
PERSON-B	the
PERSON-I	King
0	's
0	nephew
0	,
0	Maiha
0	Maiha
0	,
0	was
0	wounded
0	,
0	and
0	a
0	poor
0	woman
0	lost
0	her
0	arm
0	.

0	And
0	as
0	it
0	was
0	agreed
0	that
0	both
0	ships
0	could
0	carry
0	more
0	guns
0	,
0	if
0	any
0	were
0	to
0	be
0	purchased
0	,
0	the
0	Commodore
0	was
0	for
0	taking
0	the
0	ships
0	to
0	Canton
0	,
0	till
0	persuaded
0	from
0	it
0	by
0	some
0	gentlemen
0	belonging
0	to
0	the
0	English
0	factory
0	,
0	who
0	undertook
0	to
0	negociate
0	the
0	business
0	without
0	giving
0	umbrage
0	to
0	the
0	Chinese
0	,
0	who
0	certainly
0	would
0	,
0	they
0	said
0	,
0	be
0	offended
0	at
0	the
0	appearance
0	of
0	ships
0	of
0	war
0	in
0	their
0	river
0	,
0	and
0	would
0	oppose
0	their
0	progress
0	;

0	They
0	were
0	then
0	at
0	a
0	distance
0	from
0	the
0	turtlers
0	,
0	and
0	in
0	the
0	midst
0	a
0	trackless
0	cover
0	,
0	with
0	nothing
0	but
0	lew
0	trees
0	to
0	direct
0	their
0	return
0	;

0	and
0	of
0	their
0	manner
0	of
0	living
0	we
0	know
0	but
0	little
0	.

0	They
0	descended
0	by
0	means
0	of
0	a
0	ladder
0	,
0	made
0	by
0	cutting
0	notches
0	in
0	a
0	beam
0	,
0	deep
0	enough
0	to
0	receive
0	the
0	toes
0	and
0	the
0	ball
0	of
0	the
0	foot
0	;

0	On
0	the
0	28th
0	,
0	in
0	the
0	morning
0	,
0	we
0	sounded
0	at
0	24
0	fathom
0	,
0	the
0	tide
0	still
0	setting
0	strong
0	to
0	the
0	southward
0	at
0	the
0	rate
0	of
0	five
0	and
0	six
0	knots
0	an
0	hour
0	;

0	On
0	the
0	9th
0	,
0	at
0	five
0	,
0	A.
0	M.
0	land
0	appeared
0	from
0	S.
0	E.
0	to
0	E.
0	like
0	two
0	islands
0	,
0	but
0	,
0	after
0	fatigueing
0	trials
0	,
0	we
0	found
0	them
0	join
0	to
0	the
0	main
0	land
0	.

0	for
0	it
0	is
0	highly
0	probable
0	,
0	that
0	a
0	land
0	of
0	so
0	great
0	extent
0	contains
0	high
0	mountains
0	in
0	its
0	interior
0	parts
0	;

0	They
0	brought
0	,
0	besides
0	skins
0	,
0	great
0	quantities
0	of
0	fish
0	,
0	with
0	plenty
0	of
0	game
0	,
0	which
0	we
0	purchased
0	of
0	them
0	for
0	glass
0	bowls
0	,
0	looking-glasses
0	,
0	nails
0	,
0	hatchets
0	,
0	or
0	whatever
0	utensils
0	or
0	toys
0	were
0	either
0	useful
0	or
0	ornamental
0	.

0	Those
0	,
0	which
0	are
0	surrounded
0	by
0	a
0	reef
0	and
0	by
0	a
0	fertile
0	plain
0	,
0	along
0	the
0	sea-shores
0	,
0	have
0	commonly
0	a
0	more
0	gentle
0	slope
0	;

0	and
0	for
0	that
0	purpose
0	a
0	house
0	was
0	procured
0	for
0	the
0	reception
0	of
0	the
0	former
0	,
0	and
0	a
0	contrivance
0	made
0	for
0	having
0	the
0	latter
0	dry
0	.

0	This
0	day
0	the
0	gentlemen
0	in
0	the
0	gun-room
0	dined
0	on
0	a
0	fricassee
0	of
0	rats
0	,
0	which
0	they
0	accounted
0	a
0	venison
0	feast
0	;

PERSON-B	Capt.
PERSON-I	Cook
0	,
0	the
0	short
0	time
0	he
0	remained
0	at
0	Atooi
0	,
0	visited
0	the
0	morais
0	on
0	the
0	island
0	,
0	which
0	formerly
0	had
0	been
0	most
0	magnificent
0	structures
0	,
0	but
0	were
0	now
0	much
0	in
0	decay
0	,
0	but
0	still
0	preserved
0	all
0	the
0	appearances
0	of
0	human
0	sacrifices
0	;

0	As
0	soon
0	as
0	we
0	came
0	in
0	sight
0	,
0	she
0	made
0	sail
0	,
0	and
0	we
0	followed
0	with
0	all
0	the
0	sail
0	we
0	could
0	crowd
0	till
0	about
0	midnight
0	,
0	when
0	we
0	were
0	surprised
0	by
0	a
0	sudden
0	squall
0	,
0	which
0	split
0	our
0	main
0	top-sail
0	,
0	and
0	shivered
0	our
0	jib
0	to
0	ribbons
0	;

0	In
0	their
0	progress
0	they
0	were
0	fortunate
0	enough
0	to
0	discover
0	a
0	cove
0	,
0	the
0	most
0	convenient
0	that
0	could
0	be
0	wished
0	;

0	While
0	the
0	cutters
0	were
0	on
0	this
0	service
0	,
0	the
0	boats
0	continued
0	wooding
0	and
0	watering
0	,
0	and
0	before
0	the
0	return
0	of
0	the
0	former
0	,
0	the
0	latter
0	had
0	got
0	the
0	full
0	complement
0	of
0	both
0	on
0	board
0	,
0	and
0	the
0	ships
0	were
0	in
0	readiness
0	to
0	depart
0	.

0	He
0	was
0	a
0	most
0	affecting
0	spectacle
0	,
0	blistered
0	from
0	head
0	to
0	foot
0	by
0	poisonous
0	insects
0	,
0	whose
0	venomous
0	stings
0	had
0	caused
0	such
0	an
0	intolerable
0	itching
0	,
0	that
0	his
0	very
0	blood
0	was
0	inflamed
0	by
0	constant
0	rubbing
0	.

0	Their
0	clothing
0	consisted
0	of
0	a
0	cap
0	,
0	a
0	frock
0	,
0	a
0	pair
0	of
0	breeches
0	,
0	a
0	pair
0	of
0	boots
0	,
0	and
0	a

0	,
0	all
0	made
0	of

0	of

0	,
0	dogs
0	,

0	vessel
0	,
0	though
0	she
0	had
0	but
0	one
0	mast
0	,
0	appeared
0	to
0	be
0	higher
0	at
0	each
0	end
0	than
0	in
0	the
0	midship
0	,
0	very
0	shor
0	â€¢
0	,
0	and
0	built
0	much
0	in
0	the
0	manner
0	of
0	the
0	Chinese
0	junks
0	.

0	This

0	We

0	our

0	,
0	and
0	in
0	three

0	nothing

0	This
0	request
0	was
0	readily
0	granted
0	,
0	at
0	the
0	same
0	time
0	giving
0	the
0	Captain
0	to
0	understand
0	,
0	that
0	the
0	great
PERSON-B	King
0	was
0	absent
0	,
0	that
0	he
0	had
0	lately
0	been
0	at
0	war
0	with
PERSON-B	the
PERSON-I	King
0	of
0	the
0	neighbouring
0	island
0	of
0	Maw-whee
0	,
0	that
0	he
0	was
0	employed
0	in
0	settling
0	the

0	of

0	,
0	and
0	that
0	in
0	less

0	ten

0	he
0	was

0	.

0	On
0	the
0	1st
0	of
0	July
0	,
0	the
0	weather
0	began
0	to
0	grow
0	hazy
0	,
0	with
0	thick
0	fogs
0	.

0	but
0	now
0	,
0	on
0	our
0	return
0	,
0	it
0	was
0	matter
0	of
0	surprize
0	to
0	find
0	the
0	fruits
0	ripe
0	,
0	and
0	the
0	harvest
0	in
0	full
0	perfection
0	.

0	and
0	,
0	if
0	not
0	well
0	attended
0	to
0	,
0	often
0	alarms
0	the
0	navigator
0	with
0	the
0	fear
0	of
0	soundings
0	,
0	or
0	even
0	shoals
0	.

0	and
0	it
0	evidently
0	confirms
0	the
0	above
0	assertion
0	,
0	which
0	I
0	think
0	I
0	have
0	a
0	right
0	to
0	apply
0	to
0	the
0	freezing
0	of
0	salt-water
0	.

0	Here
0	they
0	safely
0	secured
0	their
0	cutter
0	,
0	and
0	near
0	the
0	shore
0	they
0	erected
0	a
0	kind
0	of
0	hut
0	,
0	to
0	which
0	they
0	carried
0	their
0	provisions
0	,
0	and
0	sat
0	down
0	to
0	rest
0	and
0	to
0	refresh
0	.

0	We
0	steered
0	all
0	night
0	W.
0	by
0	N.
0	and
0	next
0	morning
0	found
0	ourselves
0	almost
0	surrounded
0	with
0	fields
0	of
0	ice
0	drifting
0	to
0	the
0	southward
0	.

0	While
0	every
0	thing
0	was
0	getting
0	ready
0	,
0	the
0	officers
0	diverted
0	themselves
0	as
0	usual
0	with
0	shooting
0	and
0	surveying
0	the
0	country
0	;

0	He
0	therefore
0	advised
0	the
0	remains
0	of
0	the
0	Commander
0	to
0	be
0	deposited
0	at
0	the
0	foot
0	of
0	a
0	tree
0	,
0	the
0	scite
0	of
0	which
0	was
0	to
0	be
0	included
0	in
0	the
0	body
0	of
0	the
0	new
0	church
0	,
0	where
0	the
0	Captain
0	's
0	bones
0	might
0	probably
0	rest
0	for
0	ages
0	undisturbed
0	.

0	and
0	Next
0	day
0	,
0	March
0	1
0	,
0	about
0	noon
0	,
0	we
0	moored
0	in
0	our
0	old
0	birth
0	,
0	which
0	,
0	notwithstanding
0	,
0	had
0	a
0	most
0	beautiful
0	appearance
0	from
0	the
0	sea
0	,
0	being
0	well
0	cultivated
0	,
0	and
0	full
0	of
0	villages
0	.

0	Besides
0	the
0	natural
0	productions
0	of
0	the
0	country
0	,
0	we
0	purchased
0	in
0	these
0	islands
0	many
0	tons
0	of
0	salt
0	,
0	much
0	of
0	their
0	cordage
0	and
0	cloth
0	,
0	and
0	a
0	great
0	variety
0	of
0	artificial
0	curiosities
0	,
0	such
0	as
0	their
0	weapons
0	of
0	war
0	,
0	their
0	instruments
0	for
0	fishing
0	;

0	In
0	the
0	evening
0	a
0	fresh
0	breeze
0	sprang
0	up
0	,
0	and
0	we
0	coasted
0	along
0	shore
0	,
0	but
0	saw
0	no
0	inhabitants
0	,
0	though
0	many
0	fires
0	were
0	observed
0	in
0	the
0	night
0	within

0	.

0	In
0	the
0	rest
0	of
0	the
0	isles
0	belonging
0	to
0	the
PLACE-B	New
PLACE-I	Hebrides
0	,
0	we
0	frequently
0	observed
0	large
0	streams
0	of
0	water
0	forming
0	cascades
0	on
0	the
0	steep
0	descents
0	of
0	hills
0	,
0	and
0	thus
0	precipitating
0	themselves
0	down
0	and
0	soon
0	mixing
0	with
0	the
0	briny
0	fluid
0	of
0	the
0	ocean
0	.

0	and
0	for
0	a
0	spare
0	cable
0	for
0	our
0	small
0	bower
0	,
0	that
0	we
0	had
0	being
0	near
0	worn
0	out
0	.

0	Early
0	next
0	morning
0	,
0	we
0	once
0	more
0	attempted
0	the
0	entrance
0	of
0	the
0	bay
0	,
0	and
0	finding
0	the
0	ice
0	drifted
0	,
0	we
0	conceived
0	hopes
0	that
0	we
0	might
0	be
0	able
0	to
0	force
0	a
0	passage
0	through
0	the
0	loose
0	ice
0	,
0	which
0	,
0	now
0	the
0	weather
0	was
0	fine
0	,
0	did
0	not
0	appear
0	so
0	formidable
0	as
0	before
0	.

0	But
0	being
0	disapppointed
0	in
0	the
0	discovery
0	of
0	this
0	land
0	,
0	though
0	we
0	penetrated
0	beyond

0	,
0	and
0	once
0	beyond

0	concerning
0	the
0	existence
0	of
0	the
0	pretended
0	Southern

0	,
0	I
0	thought
0	it
0	necessary
0	to
0	enquire
0	,
0	what
0	reasons
0	chiefly
0	induced
0	the
0	above
0	authors
0	to
0	form
0	the
0	opinion
0	that
0	the
0	ice
0	floating
0	in
0	the
0	ocean
0	,
0	must
0	be
0	formed
0	near
0	land
0	,
0	or
0	that
0	an
PLACE-B	Austral
PLACE-I	land
0	is
0	absolutely
0	requisite
0	for
0	that
0	purpose
0	,
PLACE-B	F
0	and
0	having
0	looked
0	for
0	their
0	arguments
0	,
0	I
0	find
0	they
0	amount
0	chiefly
0	to
0	this

0	one

0	that

0	the

0	Our

0	obliged

0	a

0	I
0	will

0	Though

0	the

0	16

0	where

0	,
0	that

0	In

0	between
0	compleating
0	our

0	After

0	in

0	we

0	a

0	but
0	such
0	was

0	that
PERSON-B	Capt.

0	shared

0	On

0	we

0	no

0	to
0	a

0	.

0	and
0	as
0	they

0	no

0	collect
0	in

0	NOTHING

0	than
0	the
0	first

0	masses
0	of
0	ice
0	which
0	are
0	found
0	floating
0	in
0	the

0	Fortunately
0	for
0	us
0	,
0	we
0	had
0	,
0	in
0	the
0	evening
0	,
0	a
0	shift
0	of
0	wind
0	from
0	W.
0	N.
0	W.
0	with
0	a
0	steady
0	breeze
0	,
0	when
0	our
0	Captain
0	,
0	looking
0	over
0	our
0	starboard
0	quarter
0	,
0	discerned
0	the
0	ice
0	to
0	the
0	southward
0	,
0	seemingly
0	to
0	leave
0	the
0	ship
0	,
0	and
0	soon
0	heard
0	a
0	crash
0	,
0	as
0	if
0	a
0	thousand
0	rocks
0	had
0	been
0	rent
0	from
0	their
0	foundations
0	;

0	All
0	the
0	Americans
0	we
0	had
0	seen
0	since
0	our
0	arrival
0	on
0	that
0	coast
0	,
0	were
0	rather
0	low
0	of
0	stature
0	,
0	with
0	round
0	chubby
0	faces
0	,
0	and
0	high
0	cheek
0	bones
0	.

0	This
0	pond
0	was
0	connected
0	,
0	within
0	the
0	bushes
0	,
0	with
0	a
0	range
0	of
0	stagnant
0	,
0	muddy
0	waters
0	,
0	for
0	more
0	than
0	a
0	mile
0	or
0	two
0	,
0	along
0	the
0	plain
0	opposite
0	the
0	harbour
0	.

0	It
0	was
0	the
0	23d
0	before
0	the
0	Governor
0	and
0	officers
0	arrived
0	at
0	Paratounka
0	,
0	in
0	the
0	vicinage
0	of
0	which
0	the
0	priest
0	resided
0	,
0	of
0	whom
0	we
0	have
0	already
0	spoken
0	.

0	Its
0	Western
0	and
0	Northern
0	limits
0	were
0	first
0	discovered
0	in
0	1616
0	and
0	the
0	following
0	years
0	,
0	by
0	the
0	Dutch
0	navigators
0	,
0	when
0	a
0	noble
0	spirit
0	of
0	discovery
0	still
0	animated
0	the
0	governors
0	of
0	their
0	Indian
0	settlements
0	.

0	Other
0	fire-works
0	it
0	was
0	found
0	dangerous
0	to
0	exhibit
0	,
0	as
0	these
0	had
0	already
0	struck
0	the
0	spectators
0	,
PERSON-B	the
PERSON-I	King
0	as
0	well
0	as
0	his
0	people
0	,
0	with
0	a
0	general
0	panic
0	.

0	They
0	had
0	each
0	a
0	long
0	spear
0	in
0	his
0	hand
0	,
0	which
0	,
0	on
0	boarding
0	the
0	Discovery
0	,
0	they
0	delivered
0	to
0	the
0	Officer
0	on
0	the
0	deck
0	,
0	and
0	then
0	departed
0	.

0	Though
0	the
0	bucket
0	with
0	the
0	water
0	was
0	suspended
0	,
0	that
0	it
0	might
0	be
0	less
0	affected
0	by
0	the

0	of
0	the

0	,
0	the

0	still
0	moved
0	to
0	and
0	fro
0	'
0	,
0	so
0	that
0	this
0	first
0	convinced
0	me
0	,
0	that
0	these
0	luminous
0	atoms
0	had
0	a
0	voluntary
0	motion
0	,
0	quite
0	independent
0	of
0	the

0	of
0	the

0	One

0	,
0	with

PERSON-B	Capt.
PERSON-I	Cook
0	himself
0	,
0	who
0	,
0	with
0	a

0	,
0	endeavoured
0	to
0	seize
0	him
0	as

0	;

0	We
0	were
0	charmed
0	with
0	its

0	as
0	we
0	came
0	near
0	it
0	,
0	observing
0	it
0	to

0	,
0	that
0	we

0	the

0	we
0	expected
0	,
0	by

0	ourselves
0	already
0	in

0	of
0	a

0	At

0	our

0	The

0	Every

0	We

0	more

0	On

0	it
0	blew
0	a

0	In

0	,
0	the

0	As

0	,
0	who

0	on

0	,
0	though
0	much
0	against
0	the

0	of
PERSON-B	Capt.
PERSON-I	Cook
0	,
0	who
0	,
0	upon
0	the
0	first
0	arrival
0	of
0	the
0	ships
0	upon
0	the

0	,
0	wished

0	prohibited
0	all
0	commerce
0	with
0	the
0	women
0	of
0	the
0	island
0	;

0	All
0	this
0	was
0	readily
0	complied
0	with
0	,
0	and
0	the
0	procession
0	began
0	about
0	ten
0	in
0	the
0	morning
0	,
0	when
0	minute
0	guns
0	from
0	the

0	the

0	,
0	muffled
0	as

0	,
0	beat

0	On
0	the
0	31st
0	,
0	the
0	Resolution
0	plyed
0	higher

0	,
0	and
0	came
0	to
0	an
0	anchor
0	in
0	16
0	fathom
0	water
0	,
0	and
0	found
0	the
0	ebb
0	already
0	begun
0	.

0	Saw
0	several
0	birds
0	of
0	a
0	brown
0	plumage
0	hovering
0	about
0	the
0	ships
0	,
0	driven
0	from

0	by
0	the
0	storm
0	of
0	light
0	+
0	ning
0	and
0	rain
0	,
0	which
0	blew
0	in
0	heavy
0	squalls
0	.

0	We
0	saw
0	no

0	which

0	trace
0	of
0	knowledge
0	in
0	the

0	of

0	;

0	They
0	were
0	highly
0	delighted
0	with
0	the
0	music
0	,
0	and
0	would
0	not
0	suffer
0	the
0	performers
0	to

0	a

0	.

0	Next
0	day
0	both
0	Captains
0	,
0	accompanied
0	with
0	several
0	of

0	,
0	went
0	to
0	pay
PERSON-B	the
PERSON-I	King
0	a
0	visit
0	on
0	shore
0	.

0	In
0	South-georgia
0	and
0	Sandwich-land
0	,
0	we
0	met
0	with
0	no
0	springs
0	:
0	but
0	as
0	there
0	is
0	ice
0	enough
0	in
0	its
0	vicinity
0	and
0	even
0	as
0	far
0	as
0	the

0	of

0	Â°
0	South
0	latitude
0	,
0	in

0	and
0	in
0	the

0	of

0	higher

0	in
0	67
0	Â°
0	and
0	70
0	Â°
0	,
0	a

0	cannot

0	at
0	a

0	for
0	fresh

0	in
0	high
0	Southern
0	latitudes
0	.

0	They
0	then
0	searched
0	forwards
0	,
0	where
0	they
0	found
0	the
0	coal-hole
0	six
0	feet
0	deep
0	in
0	water
0	,
0	and
0	the
0	ship
0	's
0	whole
0	complement
0	of
0	paint
0	destroyed
0	;

0	At
0	the
0	close
0	of
0	the
0	evening
0	,
0	as
0	soon
0	as
0	it
0	was
0	dark
0	,
0	a
0	canoe
0	was
0	heard
0	paddling
0	towards
0	the
0	Resolution
0	,
0	in
0	which
0	were
0	two
0	men
0	.

0	They
0	paddled
0	round
0	the
0	ships
0	several
0	times
0	,
0	as
0	if
0	led
0	by
0	curiosity
0	;

0	and
0	then
0	they
0	are
0	piled
0	up
0	on
0	the
0	quarter-deck
0	,
0	where
0	the
0	salt-water
0	,
0	adhering
0	to
0	its
0	outside
0	,
0	soon
0	drains
0	away
0	;

0	6
0	of
0	the
0	1st
0	quarter
0	,
0	which
0	serves
0	to
0	bring
0	the
0	water
0	of
0	the
0	ocean
0	up
0	from
0	any
0	given
0	depth
0	:
0	they
0	ought
0	also
0	to
0	be
0	provided
0	with
0	an

0	and
0	nice
0	hydrostatical
0	balance
0	,
0	in

0	ascertain
0	the
0	specific
0	gravity
0	of
0	any
0	water
0	or
0	liquid
0	;

0	Soon
0	after
0	day-light
0	,
0	we
0	were
0	within
0	the
0	light-house
0	near
0	the
0	entrance
0	of
0	the
0	harbour
0	,
0	but
0	were
0	opposed
0	by
0	a
0	strong
0	tide
0	from
0	the
0	shore
0	,
0	which
0	drifting
0	huge
0	pieces
0	of
0	floating
0	ice
0	against
0	us
0	,
0	made
0	our
0	further
0	progress
0	both
0	dangerous
0	and
0	fatiguing
0	but
0	,
0	having
0	the
0	wind
0	fair
0	,
0	about
0	five
0	in
0	the
0	evening
0	we
0	came
0	to
0	in
0	sight
0	of
0	the
0	town
0	,
0	and
0	soon
0	after
0	dropt
0	anchor
0	near
0	the
0	Resolution
0	.

0	Lat.
0	obs
0	.

0	they
0	were
0	so
0	very
0	obliging
0	,
0	that
0	,
0	seeing
0	us
0	in
0	want
0	of
0	wood
0	to
0	burn
0	,
0	they
0	made
0	an
0	offer
0	of
0	a
0	high
0	fence
0	,
0	that
0	surrounded
0	the
0	Morai
0	,
0	adjoining
0	to
0	the
0	town
0	,
0	for
0	a
0	present
0	supply
0	.

0	but
0	they
0	will
0	suffer
0	little
0	boys

0	and
0	halter
0	them
0	,
0	which
0	is
0	done
0	by
0	passing
0	a
0	rope
0	through
0	a
0	hole
0	made
0	in
0	their
0	nostrils
0	,
0	and
0	round
0	their
0	horns
0	;

0	but
0	were
0	detained
0	in
0	the
0	bay
0	till
0	The
0	15th
0	,
0	when
0	we
0	were
0	alarmed
0	with
0	a
0	noise
0	louder
0	than
0	the
0	loudest
0	thunder
0	,
0	and
0	presently
0	were
0	almost
0	blinded
0	with
0	the
0	fall
0	of
0	ashes
0	,
0	which
0	in
0	less
0	than
0	an
0	hour
0	,
0	covered
0	the
0	decks
0	all
0	over
0	from
0	stern
0	to
0	stern
0	,
0	an
0	inch
0	thick
0	;

0	By
0	putting
0	one
0	under
0	the
0	microscope
0	,
0	we
0	observed
0	first
0	a
0	kind
0	of
0	thin
0	tube
0	going
0	into
0	the
0	substance
0	of
0	this
0	little
0	globule
0	,
0	from
0	a
0	round
0	orifice
0	on
0	its
0	surface
0	.

0	And
0	I
0	observed
0	very
0	frequently
0	,
0	in
0	the
0	years
0	1772
0	and
0	1773
0	,
0	when
0	we
0	were
0	amongst
0	the
0	ice
0	,
0	masses
0	which
0	had
0	the
0	most
0	evident
0	marks
0	of
0	such
0	a
0	formation
0	,
0	being
0	composed
0	of
0	strata
0	of
0	some
0	feet
0	in
0	thickness
0	.

0	This
0	diffused
0	a
0	joy
0	among
0	the
0	mariners
0	that
0	is
0	not
0	easy
0	to
0	be
0	expressed
0	.

0	He
0	then
0	returned
0	quite
0	exhausted
0	and
0	dejected
0	,
0	and
0	breaking
0	through
0	the
0	sedge
0	of
0	the
0	margin
0	of
0	the
0	lake
0	,
0	he
0	stumbled
0	upon
0	the
0	skeleton
0	of
0	the
0	monster
0	already
0	mentioned
0	,
0	which
0	he
0	believed
0	was
0	fifty
0	feet
0	long
0	.

0	which
0	certainly
0	is
0	very
0	considerable
0	,
0	and
0	makes
0	it
0	more
0	than
0	probably
0	,
0	that
0	the
0	ocean
0	is
0	frozen
0	in
0	winter
0	,
0	in
0	high
0	Northern
0	latitudes
0	,
0	even
0	as
0	far
0	as
0	the
0	Pole
0	.

0	but
0	instead
0	of
0	dispersing
0	,
0	they
0	now
0	made
0	a
0	general
0	attack
0	,
0	and
0	though
0	the
0	marines
0	fired
0	one
0	round
0	with
0	great
0	effect
0	,
0	the
0	crowd
0	was
0	not
0	intimidated
0	,
0	but
0	rushed
0	on
0	with
0	such
0	rapidity
0	,
0	that
0	there
0	was
0	no
0	time
0	to

0	.

0	When

0	in

0	a

0	it

0	to

0	or

0	which

0	and
0	having

0	,
0	that
0	his

0	,
0	upon

0	On
0	the

0	of
0	the
0	2d
0	,
0	some
0	parts
0	of
0	the

0	seemed
0	covered

0	of

0	,
0	and
0	myriads
0	of
0	small
0	sea
0	animals
0	were
0	seen
0	swimming

0	which

0	for

0	,
0	and
0	Trecher
0	mounted
0	the

0	within
0	his

0	,
0	from

0	towards
0	the
0	South-west
0	,
0	a

0	;

0	It
0	is
0	likewise
0	a
0	well
0	established
0	fact
0	,
0	that
0	the
0	ocean
0	,
0	itself
0	after
0	a
0	long
0	continued
0	calm
0	,
0	becomes
0	stinking
0	and
0	highly
0	putrid
0	,
0	Ã—
0	arising
0	probably
0	from
0	the
0	putrefaction
0	of
0	a
0	great
0	many
0	animal
0	substances
0	,
0	that
0	die
0	in

0	days
0	frequently
0	and
0	suddenly
0	putrefy
0	.

0	On
0	shingly
0	beaches
0	I
0	have
0	,
0	though
0	seldom
0	,
0	found
0	a
0	few
0	black
0	smooth
0	stones
0	of

0	,
0	and

0	ponderous
0	,
0	speckled

0	to
0	form
0	their
0	emittees
0	,
0	or
0	weapons
0	for
0	close
0	engagement
0	.

0	It
0	remains
0	now
0	only
0	to
0	give
0	a
0	short
0	description
0	of
0	the
0	bay
0	and
0	harbour
0	where
0	we
0	repaired
0	,
0	which
0	at
0	the
0	entrance
0	is
0	between
0	two
0	very
0	high
0	bluff
0	rocks
0	.

0	Some
0	groups
0	of
0	the
0	finest
0	trees
0	and
0	flowering
0	shrubs
0	,
0	together
0	with
0	the
0	impending
0	venerable
0	rocks
0	from
0	whence
0	the
0	water
0	issued
0	,
0	involved
0	it
0	in
0	a
0	constant
0	shade
0	,
0	and
0	preserved
0	a
0	delicious
0	coolness
0	.

0	But
0	there
0	may
0	perhaps
0	be
0	other
0	methods
0	to
0	obviate
0	this
0	defect
0	,
0	of
0	which
0	our
0	narrow
0	knowledge
0	and
0	experience
0	have
0	not
0	yet
0	informed

0	.

0	The

0	were
0	then
0	ordered
0	out
0	,
0	and
0	sent
0	to
PLACE-B	Macao
0	for

0	In
0	their

0	they
0	found
0	something
0	like
0	an

0	,
0	being
0	a

0	pit
0	sunk

0	to
0	creep

0	about

0	square
0	.

0	A

0	,
0	*
0	of

0	that

0	the
0	weight

0	in

0	Northern
0	.

0	It
0	was
